| **[Expanding Performance Boundaries of Open-Source Multimodal Models with Model, Data, and Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05271v5)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce InternVL 2.5, an advanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) series that builds upon InternVL 2.0, maintaining its core model architecture while introducing significant enhancements in training and testing strategies as well as data quality. In this work, we delve into the relationship between model scaling and performance, systematically exploring the performance trends in vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and test-time configurations. Through extensive evaluations on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, multi-image / video understanding, real-world comprehension, multimodal hallucination detection, visual grounding, multilingual capabilities, and pure language processing, InternVL 2.5 exhibits competitive performance, rivaling leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Notably, our model is the first open-source MLLMs to surpass 70% on the MMMU benchmark, achieving a 3.7-point improvement through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and showcasing strong potential for test-time scaling. We hope this model contributes to the open-source community by setting new standards for developing and applying multimodal AI systems.

| **[Think With Videos For Agentic Long-Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10821v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).</p></details> |  |
| **[VidBridge-R1: Bridging QA and Captioning for RL-based Video Understanding Models with Intermediate Proxy Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09079v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "Reason-Then-Respond" paradigm, enhanced by Reinforcement Learning, has shown great promise in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models. However, its application to the video domain has led to specialized models that excel at either question answering (QA) or captioning tasks, but struggle to master both. Naively combining reward signals from these tasks results in mutual performance degradation, which we attribute to a conflict between their opposing task natures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training framework built upon two intermediate proxy tasks: DarkEventInfer, which presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues; and MixVidQA, which presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. These proxy tasks compel the model to simultaneously develop both holistic, divergent understanding and precise, convergent reasoning capabilities. Embodying this framework, we present VidBridge-R1, the first versatile video reasoning model that effectively bridges the paradigm conflict. Extensive experiments show that VidBridge-R1 achieves significant performance gains on both QA and captioning within one model, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in fostering more generalizable and powerful video understanding models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-guided Representation Disentanglement for Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21783v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found in https://github.com/iamsnaping/ProDA.git</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoJudge: Bootstrapping Enables Scalable Supervision of MLLM-as-a-Judge for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21451v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks, VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation of video understanding tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[MoCLIP-Lite: Efficient Video Recognition by Fusing CLIP with Motion Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17084v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, but state-of-the-art models are often computationally expensive and rely on extensive video pre-training. In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/microa/MoCLIP-Lite.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Long Video Understanding with Learnable Retrieval in Video-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04931v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made them attractive for application to video understanding, utilizing video tokens as contextual input. However, employing LLMs for long video understanding presents significant challenges. The extensive number of video tokens leads to considerable computational costs for LLMs while using aggregated tokens results in loss of vision details. Moreover, the presence of abundant question-irrelevant tokens introduces noise to the video reasoning process. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet effective learnable retrieval-based video-language model (R-VLM) for efficient long video understanding. Specifically, given a question (query) and a long video, our model identifies and selects the most relevant K video chunks and uses their associated visual tokens to serve as context for the LLM inference. This effectively reduces the number of video tokens, eliminates noise interference, and enhances system performance. We achieve this by incorporating a learnable lightweight MLP block to facilitate the efficient retrieval of question-relevant chunks, through the end-to-end training of our video-language model with a proposed soft matching loss. Our experimental results on multiple zero-shot video question answering datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework for comprehending long videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[COLT: Enhancing Video Large Language Models with Continual Tool Usage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18754v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[SurgVidLM: Towards Multi-grained Surgical Video Understanding with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17873v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical scene understanding is critical for surgical training and robotic decision-making in robot-assisted surgery. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated great potential for advancing scene perception in the medical domain, facilitating surgeons to understand surgical scenes and procedures. However, these methods are primarily oriented towards image-based analysis or global video understanding, overlooking the fine-grained video reasoning that is crucial for analyzing specific processes and capturing detailed task execution within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM, the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K that is a large-scale dataset with over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures. Building on this resource, SurgVidLM incorporates a two-stage StageFocus mechanism: the first stage extracts global procedural context, while the second stage performs high-frequency local analysis guided by temporal cues. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively integrate low- and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the preservation of critical task-specific details. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs of comparable parameter scale in both full and fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in capturing the context of complex robot-assisted surgeries. Our code and dataset will be publicly accessible soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning, causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end, we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical, interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular, training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning. Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for post-hoc driving video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConViS-Bench: Estimating Video Similarity Through Semantic Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19245v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains. Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[VIR-Bench: Evaluating Geospatial and Temporal Understanding of MLLMs via Travel Video Itinerary Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19002v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surgical Video Understanding with Label Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18802v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding. Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[AHA -- Predicting What Matters Next: Online Highlight Detection Without Looking Ahead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16421v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time understanding of continuous video streams is essential for intelligent agents operating in high-stakes environments, including autonomous vehicles, surveillance drones, and disaster response robots. Yet, most existing video understanding and highlight detection methods assume access to the entire video during inference, making them unsuitable for online or streaming scenarios. In particular, current models optimize for offline summarization, failing to support step-by-step reasoning needed for real-time decision-making. We introduce Aha, an autoregressive highlight detection framework that predicts the relevance of each video frame against a task described in natural language. Without accessing future video frames, Aha utilizes a multimodal vision-language model and lightweight, decoupled heads trained on a large, curated dataset of human-centric video labels. To enable scalability, we introduce the Dynamic SinkCache mechanism that achieves constant memory usage across infinite-length streams without degrading performance on standard benchmarks. This encourages the hidden representation to capture high-level task objectives, enabling effective frame-level rankings for informativeness, relevance, and uncertainty with respect to the natural language task. Aha achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on highlight detection benchmarks, surpassing even prior offline, full-context approaches and video-language models by +5.9% on TVSum and +8.3% on Mr. Hisum in mAP (mean Average Precision). We explore Aha's potential for real-world robotics applications given a task-oriented natural language input and a continuous, robot-centric video. Both experiments demonstrate Aha's potential effectiveness as a real-time reasoning module for downstream planning and long-horizon understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025, 32 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[STORM: Token-Efficient Long Video Understanding for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04130v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to $8\times$ and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9$\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

| **[LongLLaVA: Scaling Multi-modal LLMs to 1000 Images Efficiently via a Hybrid Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02889v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expanding the long-context capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) is critical for advancing video understanding and high-resolution image analysis. Achieving this requires systematic improvements in model architecture, data construction, and training strategies, particularly to address challenges such as performance degradation with increasing image counts and high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba and Transformer blocks, introduce data construction methods that capture both temporal and spatial dependencies, and employ a progressive training strategy. Our released model, LongLLaVA (\textbf{Long}-Context \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{a}nd \textbf{V}ision \textbf{A}ssistant), demonstrates an effective balance between efficiency and performance. LongLLaVA achieves competitive results across various benchmarks while maintaining high throughput and low memory consumption. Notably, it can process nearly one thousand images on a single A100 80GB GPU, underscoring its potential for a wide range of multi-modal applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[NeuS-QA: Grounding Long-Form Video Understanding in Temporal Logic and Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18041v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-Form Video Question Answering (LVQA) poses challenges beyond traditional visual question answering (VQA), which is often limited to static images or short video clips. While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in those settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos involving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches, which sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur significant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model often misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key temporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these limitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling, hierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However, these methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal representations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a result, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually encodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language question into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton from frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to rigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on LongVideoBench and CinePile show NeuS-QA improves performance by over 10%, especially on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step compositional reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Audio Matter for Modern Video-LLMs and Their Benchmarks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17901v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern multimodal large language models often claim "video understanding," yet most evaluations use muted videos or simply discard audio. We ask a direct question: how much does audio actually matter for contemporary Video-LLMs and the benchmarks that certify them? We audit widely used suites and observe that many items are even solvable from a single frame, rendering audio largely redundant. Building on LLaVA-OneVision architecture, we attach a speech/audio encoder (e.g., Whisper) and analyze when audio helps, while addressing audio token explosion with a lightweight Mamba-based state-space token compressor. We find that audio yields minimal gains on recent video benchmarks but is decisive on curated, audio-sensitive subsets. To enable faithful evaluation, we release AVQA-Hard and Music-AVQA-Hard, our model, and code. Our findings surface a growing gap between current academic practice and real-world expectations, and provide practical tools for scalable audio-visual Video-LLMs. We will fully open-source our work at https://github.com/naver-ai/LLaVA-AV-SSM.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, under review.

To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 9 tasks from the stroke level to the rally level and includes 2943 human-verified questions. Evaluating 17 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfiniBench: A Benchmark for Large Multi-Modal Models in Long-Form Movies and TV Shows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19875v4)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding long-form videos, such as movies and TV episodes ranging from tens of minutes to two hours, remains a significant challenge for multi-modal models. Existing benchmarks often fail to test the full range of cognitive skills needed to process these temporally rich and narratively complex inputs. Therefore, we introduce InfiniBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of models in long video understanding rigorously. InfiniBench offers:(1) Over 1,000 hours of video content, with an average video length of 53 minutes. (2) The largest set of question-answer pairs for long video comprehension, totaling around 87.7 K. (3) Eight diverse skills that span both grounding-based (e.g., scene transitions, character actions) and reasoning-based (e.g., deep context understanding, multi-event linking). (4) Rich annotation formats, including both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. We conducted an in-depth evaluation across both commercial (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) and most recent open-source vision-language models such as Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3.0). Results reveal that:(1) Models struggle across the board: Even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 47.1 % on grounding-based skills, with most models performing near or just above random chance. (2) Strong reliance on world knowledge: Models achieve surprisingly high scores using only metadata (e.g., video titles), highlighting a tendency to rely on pre-trained knowledge rather than actual visual or temporal understanding. (3) Multi-Modal Importance: When provided with full video and subtitle context, however, models show substantial improvements, confirming the critical role of multimodal input in video understanding. InfiniBench is publicly available at https://vision-cair.github.io/Infinibench</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

While recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot caption generation, we observe that such captions tend to be generic and indistinguishable across visually similar videos, limiting their utility for fine-grained retrieval. Moreover, conventional captioning approaches are typically evaluated using language generation metrics, such as BLEU, which are not typically tailored for retrieval tasks that require making discriminative distinctions between candidates. To address this, we propose $\textbf{CaRe-DPO}$, a retrieval framework that directly optimizes caption generation using retrieval relevance scores. At its core is Dual-Group Direct Preference Optimization (DG-DPO), a novel learning strategy that supervises captioning by modeling preferences across groups of distinct video and caption pairs. In addition, we present an MLLM-based retrieval model that incorporates role-embeddings to better distinguish between textual inputs with different functional roles, such as an auxiliary caption and a text query. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CaRe-DPO significantly enhances retrieval performance by effectively leveraging auxiliary knowledge to generate fine-grained captions for retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/CaReDPO.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[ChronoForge-RL: Chronological Forging through Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15800v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames. Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B parameter alternatives.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

Computer-assisted systems support full surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST, SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical care and training.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video understanding models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Stron...</summary><p>Strong accept by NeurIPS2025 Reviewers and AC, but reject by PC.

It addresses two fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1) limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses.

However, existing VLAs are limited to predicting short-sighted next-action, which struggle with long-horizon trajectory tasks due to incremental deviations. To address this problem, we propose a plug-in framework named VLA-Reasoner that effectively empowers off-the-shelf VLAs with the capability of foreseeing future states via test-time scaling. Specifically, VLA-Reasoner samples and rolls out possible action trajectories where involved actions are rationales to generate future states via a world model, which enables VLA-Reasoner to foresee and reason potential outcomes and search for the optimal actions. We further leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve search efficiency in large action spaces, where stepwise VLA predictions seed the root. Meanwhile, we introduce a confidence sampling mechanism based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to enable efficient exploration in MCTS without redundant VLA queries. We evaluate intermediate states in MCTS via an offline reward shaping strategy, to score predicted futures and correct deviations with long-term feedback. We conducted extensive experiments in both simulators and the real world, demonstrating that our proposed VLA-Reasoner achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art VLAs. Our method highlights a potential pathway toward scalable test-time computation of robotic manipulation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses. Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in healthcare.

Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection, segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks. Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second opinions.</p></details> |  |

Current clinical practice often relies on diagnostic biomarkers in QSM and NM-MRI images. However, the lack of large, high-quality datasets makes training diagnostic models from scratch prone to overfitting. Adapting pre-trained 3D medical models is also challenging, as the diversity of medical imaging leads to mismatches in voxel spacing and modality between pre-training and fine-tuning data. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging 2D vision foundation models (VFMs). Specifically, we crop multiple key ROIs from NM and QSM images, process each ROI through separate branches to compress the ROI into a token, and then combine these tokens into a unified patient representation for classification. Within each branch, we use 2D VFMs to encode axial slices of the 3D ROI volume and fuse them into the ROI token, guided by an auxiliary segmentation head that steers the feature extraction toward specific brain nuclei. Additionally, we introduce multi-ROI supervised contrastive learning, which improves diagnostic performance by pulling together representations of patients from the same class while pushing away those from different classes. Our approach achieved first place in the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation challenge, with an accuracy of 86.0% trained on a dataset of only 300 labeled QSM and NM-MRI scans, outperforming the second-place method by 5.5%.These results highlight the potential of 2D VFMs for clinical analysis of 3D MR images.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First-place solution of the classification track for MICCAI'2025 PDCADxFoundation Challenge</p></details> |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey on the Trustworthiness of Large Language Models in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15871v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare holds significant promise for enhancing clinical decision-making, medical research, and patient care. However, their integration into real-world clinical settings raises critical concerns around trustworthiness, particularly around dimensions of truthfulness, privacy, safety, robustness, fairness, and explainability. These dimensions are essential for ensuring that LLMs generate reliable, unbiased, and ethically sound outputs. While researchers have recently begun developing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks to assess LLM trustworthiness, the trustworthiness of LLMs in healthcare remains underexplored, lacking a systematic review that provides a comprehensive understanding and future insights. This survey addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive review of current methodologies and solutions aimed at mitigating risks across key trust dimensions. We analyze how each dimension affects the reliability and ethical deployment of healthcare LLMs, synthesize ongoing research efforts, and identify critical gaps in existing approaches. We also identify emerging challenges posed by evolving paradigms, such as multi-agent collaboration, multi-modal reasoning, and the development of small open-source medical models. Our goal is to guide future research toward more trustworthy, transparent, and clinically viable LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating Clinical AI Assistance using Multimodal LLMs: A Case Study in Diabetic Retinopathy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13234v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open, lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust in clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedS$^3$: Towards Medical Slow Thinking with Self-Evolved Soft Dual-sided Process Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12051v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical language models face critical barriers to real-world clinical reasoning applications. However, mainstream efforts, which fall short in task coverage, lack fine-grained supervision for intermediate reasoning steps, and rely on proprietary systems, are still far from a versatile, credible and efficient language model for clinical reasoning usage. To this end, we propose \mone, a self-evolving framework that imparts robust reasoning capabilities to small, deployable models. Starting with 8,000 curated instances sampled via a curriculum strategy across five medical domains and 16 datasets, we use a small base policy model to conduct Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for constructing rule-verifiable reasoning trajectories. Self-explored reasoning trajectories ranked by node values are used to bootstrap the policy model via reinforcement fine-tuning and preference learning. Moreover, we introduce a soft dual process reward model that incorporates value dynamics: steps that degrade node value are penalized, enabling fine-grained identification of reasoning errors even when the final answer is correct. Experiments on eleven benchmarks show that \mone outperforms the previous state-of-the-art medical model by +6.45 accuracy points and surpasses 32B-scale general-purpose reasoning models by +8.57 points. Additional empirical analysis further demonstrates that \mone achieves robust and faithful reasoning behavior.</p></details> | 20 pages; |
| **[AURAD: Anatomy-Pathology Unified Radiology Synthesis with Progressive Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04819v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image synthesis has become an essential strategy for augmenting datasets and improving model generalization in data-scarce clinical settings. However, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to limited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing methods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to generalize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically diverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these challenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that jointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity, controllability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks that capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological consistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first generated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then used to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical models to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual realism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and real-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are classified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of predicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code, pre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Psychiatry-Bench: A Multi-Task Benchmark for LLMs in Psychiatry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09711v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise in enhancing psychiatric practice, from improving diagnostic accuracy to streamlining clinical documentation and therapeutic support. However, existing evaluation resources heavily rely on small clinical interview corpora, social media posts, or synthetic dialogues, which limits their clinical validity and fails to capture the full complexity of psychiatric reasoning. In this work, we introduce PsychiatryBench, a rigorously curated benchmark grounded exclusively in authoritative, expert-validated psychiatric textbooks and casebooks. PsychiatryBench comprises eleven distinct question-answering tasks ranging from diagnostic reasoning and treatment planning to longitudinal follow-up, management planning, clinical approach, sequential case analysis, and multiple-choice/extended matching formats totaling over 5,300 expert-annotated items. We evaluate a diverse set of frontier LLMs (including Google Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMA 3, and QWQ-32) alongside leading open-source medical models (e.g., OpenBiloLLM, MedGemma) using both conventional metrics and an "LLM-as-judge" similarity scoring framework. Our results reveal substantial gaps in clinical consistency and safety, particularly in multi-turn follow-up and management tasks, underscoring the need for specialized model tuning and more robust evaluation paradigms. PsychiatryBench offers a modular, extensible platform for benchmarking and improving LLM performance in high-stakes mental health applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMEval-Med: A Real-world Clinical Benchmark for Medical LLMs with Physician Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04078v3)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoneyBee: A Scalable Modular Framework for Creating Multimodal Oncology Datasets with Foundational Embedding Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07460v5)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>HONeYBEE (Harmonized ONcologY Biomedical Embedding Encoder) is an open-source framework that integrates multimodal biomedical data for oncology applications. It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Agent Approach to Neurological Clinical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14063v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration, and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly (52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis, and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus 69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.</p></details> |  |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray) and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings, we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025 1st Workshop on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Clinical Practice</p></details> |

However, accessibility remains a low priority in university curricula. This project explores the feasibility of an alternative learning experience aimed at increasing the accessibility literacy of young content creators, taking web accessibility as a case study. We propose a mini module that uses simple, easy-to-use training materials, such as infographics and short quizzes, and can be easily incorporated in educational programmes along existing courses. A survey was conducted to investigate the participants' accessibility literacy before and after training. The findings show that young content creators generally have limited accessibility literacy but even brief exposure to accessibility materials contributed to a shift in perceptions. After training, participants expressed more willingness to implement accessibility tools in their content, with ways varying depending on content type and purpose. This suggests that small, yet targeted interventions could be an alternative for integrating accessibility training into formal education across various disciplines. While some responses reflected traces of the medical model of disability and a particularlist view of accessibility, accessibility was recognised as important for increasing inclusion, improving content, and shaping a fairer society.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master thesis: MASTER OF ARTS IN ACCESSIBILITY TO MEDIA, ARTS AND CULTURE</p></details> |

However, their deployment faces two key challenges. \textit{distribution shift} where pre-training and post-training data distributions differ (e.g., due to inter-center image acquisition) and \textit{confidence misalignment}, which leads to overconfident errors. These issues surface differently, vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) suffer from 2D embedding shift (image-text misalignment), while medical models (e.g., SAM) encounter 3D domain shifts (e.g., scanner variation) and voxel-wise calibration need. Existing solutions are domain-specific. We propose \textbf{StaRFM}, a fusion of Fisher information penalty (FIP) and confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) tackling both challenges. It applies FIP, extended to 3D via patch-wise regularization, to reduce embedding shift, and CMP, reformulated for voxel-level predictions, to calibrate segmentation uncertainty. We derive PAC-Bayes bounds. FIP controls generalization via the Fisher-Rao norm, and CMP reduces calibration error via Brier score minimization. StaRFM surpasses baselines by \texttt{+}3.5\% accuracy and 28\% lower ECE on 19 vision datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Office-Home), achieves +4.2\% DSC over SAM-FT and 4.8mm HD95 on medical benchmarks (e.g., BraTS, ATLAS), and reduces cross-domain gaps by up to 20\%. The framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal architectural changes.

With the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in the medical field, leveraging these technologies for the Medical Quality Control Indicator Calculation (MQCIC) presents a promising approach. In this work, (1) we introduce a real-world task MQCIC and propose an open-source Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs)-based dataset (CMQCIC-Bench) comprising 785 instances and 76 indicators. (2) We propose a semi-automatic method to enhance the rule representation. Then we propose the Clinical Facts-based Inferential Rule (CF-IR) method that disentangles the clinical fact verification and inferential rule reasoning actions. (3) We conduct comprehensive experiments on 20 representative LLMs, covering general and medical models. Our findings reveal that CF-IR outperforms Chain-of-Thought methods in MQCIC tasks. (4) We conduct an error analysis and investigate the capabilities of clinical fact verification and inferential rule reasoning, providing insights to improve performance in the MQCIC further.

| **[The Limited Impact of Medical Adaptation of Large Language and Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08870v3)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several recent works seek to adapt general-purpose large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for medical applications through continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining improves performance on various downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical exam questions. In this paper, we compare ten "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical question answering (QA). For instance, on clinical-note-based QA tasks in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs outperform their base models in only 26.7% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 16.7% of cases, and perform significantly worse in the remaining 56.7% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model directly against its base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of EMNLP 2024 paper arXiv:2411.04118.

The Problem with Multiple-Choice Questions in Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02394v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrate significant potential in the medical domain and are often evaluated using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) modeled on exams like the USMLE. However, such benchmarks may overestimate true clinical understanding by rewarding pattern recognition and test-taking heuristics. To investigate this, we created a fictional medical benchmark centered on an imaginary organ, the Glianorex, allowing us to separate memorized knowledge from reasoning ability. We generated textbooks and MCQs in English and French using leading LLMs, then evaluated proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific models in a zero-shot setting. Despite the fictional content, models achieved an average score of 64%, while physicians scored only 27%. Fine-tuned medical models outperformed base models in English but not in French. Ablation and interpretability analyses revealed that models frequently relied on shallow cues, test-taking strategies, and hallucinated reasoning to identify the correct choice. These results suggest that standard MCQ-based evaluations may not effectively measure clinical reasoning and highlight the need for more robust, clinically meaningful assessment methods for LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 main |
| **[XrayGPT: Chest Radiographs Summarization using Medical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07971v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The latest breakthroughs in large vision-language models, such as Bard and GPT-4, have showcased extraordinary abilities in performing a wide range of tasks. Such models are trained on massive datasets comprising billions of public image-text pairs with diverse tasks. However, their performance on task-specific domains, such as radiology, is still under-investigated and potentially limited due to a lack of sophistication in understanding biomedical images. On the other hand, conversational medical models have exhibited remarkable success but have mainly focused on text-based analysis. In this paper, we introduce XrayGPT, a novel conversational medical vision-language model that can analyze and answer open-ended questions about chest radiographs. Specifically, we align both medical visual encoder (MedClip) with a fine-tuned large language model (Vicuna), using a simple linear transformation. This alignment enables our model to possess exceptional visual conversation abilities, grounded in a deep understanding of radiographs and medical domain knowledge. To enhance the performance of LLMs in the medical context, we generate ~217k interactive and high-quality summaries from free-text radiology reports. These summaries serve to enhance the performance of LLMs through the fine-tuning process. Our approach opens up new avenues the research for advancing the automated analysis of chest radiographs.

However, these developments have mainly benefited a small number of high-resource languages such as English. The majority of languages still face significant challenges due to the scarcity of training data and computational resources. To address this issue, this thesis focuses on cross-lingual transfer learning, a research area aimed at leveraging data and models from high-resource languages to improve NLP performance for low-resource languages. Specifically, we focus on Sequence Labeling tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Opinion Target Extraction, and Argument Mining. The research is structured around three main objectives: (1) advancing data-based cross-lingual transfer learning methods through improved translation and annotation projection techniques, (2) developing enhanced model-based transfer learning approaches utilizing state-of-the-art multilingual models, and (3) applying these methods to real-world problems while creating open-source resources that facilitate future research in low-resource NLP. More specifically, this thesis presents a new method to improve data-based transfer with T-Projection, a state-of-the-art annotation projection method that leverages text-to-text multilingual models and machine translation systems. T-Projection significantly outperforms previous annotation projection methods by a wide margin. For model-based transfer, we introduce a constrained decoding algorithm that enhances cross-lingual Sequence Labeling in zero-shot settings using text-to-text models. Finally, we develop Medical mT5, the first multilingual text-to-text medical model, demonstrating the practical impact of our research on real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral Thesis: University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU</p></details> |

While 3D volumes offer superior real-world applicability, they are less available for each modality and not easy to train in large scale, whereas 2D samples are abundant but less comprehensive. This paper introduces Cross-D Conv operation, a novel approach that bridges the dimensional gap by learning the phase shifting in the Fourier domain. Our method enables seamless weight transfer between 2D and 3D convolution operations, effectively facilitating cross-dimensional learning. The proposed architecture leverages the abundance of 2D training data to enhance 3D model performance, offering a practical solution to the multimodal data scarcity challenge in 3D medical model pretraining. Experimental validation on the RadImagenet (2D) and multimodal volumetric sets demonstrates that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance in feature quality assessment. The enhanced convolution operation presents new opportunities for developing efficient classification and segmentation models in medical imaging. This work represents an advancement in cross-dimensional and multimodal medical image analysis, offering a robust framework for utilizing 2D priors in 3D model pretraining while maintaining computational efficiency of 2D training.

| **[Bidirectional Brain Image Translation using Transfer Learning from Generic Pre-trained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12488v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of various neurological disorders, providing valuable insights into the structure and function of the brain. Techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) enable non-invasive visualization of the brain, aiding in the understanding of brain anatomy, abnormalities, and functional connectivity. However, cost and radiation dose may limit the acquisition of specific image modalities, so medical image synthesis can be used to generate required medical images without actual addition. In the medical domain, where obtaining labeled medical images is labor-intensive and expensive, addressing data scarcity is a major challenge. Recent studies propose using transfer learning to overcome this issue. This involves adapting pre-trained CycleGAN models, initially trained on non-medical data, to generate realistic medical images. In this work, transfer learning was applied to the task of MR-CT image translation and vice versa using 18 pre-trained non-medical models, and the models were fine-tuned to have the best result. The models' performance was evaluated using four widely used image quality metrics: Peak-signal-to-noise-ratio, Structural Similarity Index, Universal Quality Index, and Visual Information Fidelity. Quantitative evaluation and qualitative perceptual analysis by radiologists demonstrate the potential of transfer learning in medical imaging and the effectiveness of the generic pre-trained model. The results provide compelling evidence of the model's exceptional performance, which can be attributed to the high quality and similarity of the training images to actual human brain images. These results underscore the significance of carefully selecting appropriate and representative training images to optimize performance in brain image analysis tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, these methods face challenges including limited data insufficiency to support extensive pre-training and can not align responses with users' instructions. To address these issues, we introduce a medical instruction dataset, CMedINS, containing six medical instructions derived from actual medical tasks, which effectively fine-tunes LLM in conjunction with other data. Subsequently, We launch our medical model, IIMedGPT, employing an efficient preference alignment method, Direct preference Optimization(DPO). The results show that our final model outperforms existing medical models in medical dialogue.Datsets, Code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

LLMs' ability to coalesce vast amounts of information from many sources to generate a response-a process similar to that of a human expert-has led many to see potential in deploying LLMs for clinical use. However, medicine is a setting where accurate reasoning is paramount. Many researchers are questioning the effectiveness of multiple choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, frequently used to test LLMs. Researchers and clinicians alike must have complete confidence in LLMs' abilities for them to be deployed in a medical setting. To address this need for understanding, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-based method to evaluate the biomedical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Essentially, we map how LLMs link medical concepts in order to better understand how they reason. We test GPT-4, Llama3-70b, and PalmyraMed-70b, a specialized medical model. We enlist a panel of medical students to review a total of 60 LLM-generated graphs and compare these graphs to BIOS, a large biomedical KG. We observe GPT-4 to perform best in our human review but worst in our ground truth comparison; vice-versa with PalmyraMed, the medical model. Our work provides a means of visualizing the medical reasoning pathways of LLMs so they can be implemented in clinical settings safely and effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 19 pages</p></details> |

However, these models often struggle to capture a deep understanding of diseases due to their broad generalization across the entire medical field. To address this gap, I present DisEmbed, a disease-focused embedding model. DisEmbed is trained on a synthetic dataset specifically curated to include disease descriptions, symptoms, and disease-related Q\&A pairs, making it uniquely suited for disease-related tasks. For evaluation, I benchmarked DisEmbed against existing medical models using disease-specific datasets and the triplet evaluation method. My results demonstrate that DisEmbed outperforms other models, particularly in identifying disease-related contexts and distinguishing between similar diseases. This makes DisEmbed highly valuable for disease-specific use cases, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks, where its performance is particularly robust.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieves strong efficacy, with 50% sensitivity in predicting first cancer risks at 99% specificity cutoff, and outperforming feature-based tree models and both general and medical LLMs by up to 20% AUPRC. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

While robust evaluation frameworks are crucial for the safe development of medical LLMs, resources in Japanese remain limited, often relying on translated multiple-choice questions. Our research addresses this gap by first establishing a performance baseline, applying a machine-translated version of HealthBench's 5,000 scenarios to evaluate both a high-performing multilingual model (GPT-4.1) and a Japanese-native open-source model (LLM-jp-3.1). Second, we employ an LLM-as-a-Judge approach to systematically classify the benchmark's scenarios and rubric criteria, identifying "contextual gaps" where content is misaligned with Japan's clinical guidelines, healthcare systems, or cultural norms. Our findings reveal a modest performance drop in GPT-4.1 due to rubric mismatches and a significant failure in the Japanese-native model, which lacked the required clinical completeness. Furthermore, our classification indicates that while the majority of scenarios are applicable, a substantial portion of the rubric criteria requires localization. This work underscores the limitations of direct benchmark translation and highlights the urgent need for a context-aware, localized adaptation, a J-HealthBench, to ensure the reliable and safe evaluation of medical LLMs in Japan.</p></details> | draft v0.1 |
| **[SparseDoctor: Towards Efficient Chat Doctor with Mixture of Experts Enhanced Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14269v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in medical question answering and clinical decision-making, promoting the efficiency and popularization of the personalized virtual doctor in society. However, the traditional fine-tuning strategies on LLM require the updates of billions of parameters, substantially increasing the training cost, including the training time and utility cost. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the current medical LLMs and explore the boundary of the representation capability of the LLMs on the medical domain, apart from the traditional fine-tuning strategies from the data perspective (i.e., supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback), we instead craft a novel sparse medical LLM named SparseDoctor armed with contrastive learning enhanced LoRA-MoE (low rank adaptation-mixture of experts) architecture. To this end, the crafted automatic routing mechanism can scientifically allocate the computational resources among different LoRA experts supervised by the contrastive learning. Additionally, we also introduce a novel expert memory queue mechanism to further boost the efficiency of the overall framework and prevent the memory overflow during training. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three typical medical benchmarks: CMB, CMExam, and CMMLU-Med. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM can consistently outperform the strong baselines such as the HuatuoGPT series.</p></details> |  |

However, the extent to which this high performance is transferable to medical questions in Spanish and from a Latin American country remains unexplored. This knowledge is crucial as LLM-based medical applications gain traction in Latin America. AIMS: to build a dataset of questions from medical examinations taken by Peruvian physicians pursuing specialty training; to fine-tune a LLM on this dataset; to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of accuracy between vanilla LLMs and the fine-tuned LLM. METHODS: We curated PeruMedQA, a multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) datasets containing 8,380 questions spanning 12 medical domains (2018-2025). We selected eight medical LLMs including medgemma-4b-it and medgemma-27b-text-it, and developed zero-shot task-specific prompts to answer the questions appropriately. We employed parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT)and low-rant adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune medgemma-4b-it utilizing all questions except those from 2025 (test set). RESULTS: medgemma-27b-text-it outperformed all other models, achieving a proportion of correct answers exceeding 90% in several instances. LLMs with <10 billion parameters exhibited <60% of correct answers, while some exams yielded results <50%. The fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it emerged victorious agains all LLMs with <10 billion parameters and rivaled a LLM with 70 billion parameters across various examinations. CONCLUSIONS: For medical AI application and research that require knowledge bases from Spanish-speaking countries and those exhibiting similar epidemiological profiles to Peru's, interested parties should utilize medgemma-27b-text-it or a fine-tuned version of medgemma-4b-it.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rodrigo-carrillo/PeruMedQA</p></details> |

To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce three new benchmarks: YakugakuQA, based on national pharmacist licensing exams; NayoseQA, which tests cross-lingual synonym and terminology normalization; and SogoCheck, a novel task designed to assess consistency reasoning between paired statements. We evaluate our model against both open-source medical LLMs and commercial models, including GPT-4o. Results show that our domain-specific model outperforms existing open models and achieves competitive performance with commercial ones, particularly on terminology-heavy and knowledge-based tasks. Interestingly, even GPT-4o performs poorly on SogoCheck, suggesting that cross-sentence consistency reasoning remains an open challenge. Our benchmark suite offers a broader diagnostic lens for pharmaceutical NLP, covering factual recall, lexical variation, and logical consistency. This work demonstrates the feasibility of building practical, secure, and cost-effective language models for Japanese domain-specific applications, and provides reusable evaluation resources for future research in pharmaceutical and healthcare NLP.

However, there is a notable gap between the performance of medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale, high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter trade-off for medical AI deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Baich...</summary><p>Baichuan-M2 Technical Report</p></details> |

To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts. Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

However, existing large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought (CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains.

| **[DentalBench: Benchmarking and Advancing LLMs Capability for Bilingual Dentistry Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20416v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However, their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale, high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks, and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

Beyond merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic information retrieval tools to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems capable of supporting complex healthcare decisions. We provide a thorough analysis of the enabling technological foundations, with a particular focus on specialized prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and recent breakthroughs in Reinforcement Learning exemplified by DeepSeek-R1. Our investigation evaluates purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures. The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective partners in clinical practice and medical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedOmni-45°: A Safety-Performance Benchmark for Reasoning-Oriented LLMs in Medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16213v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought (CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts -- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness. Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source, general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45 Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81 Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both.

In healthcare, where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks, including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding. Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes exceed that of model choice.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProMed: Shapley Information Gain Guided Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Medical LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13514v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients. While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG) reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1) SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2) SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing robustly to out-of-domain cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reverse Physician-AI Relationship: Full-process Clinical Diagnosis Driven by a Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10492v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore, DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses, delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy, with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI, traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and accurate diagnostic solution.</p></details> | 39 pages |
| **[A Novel Evaluation Benchmark for Medical LLMs: Illuminating Safety and Effectiveness in Clinical Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23486v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in clinical decision support but face major challenges in safety evaluation and effectiveness validation. We developed the Clinical Safety-Effectiveness Dual-Track Benchmark (CSEDB), a multidimensional framework built on clinical expert consensus, encompassing 30 criteria covering critical areas like critical illness recognition, guideline adherence, and medication safety, with weighted consequence measures. Thirty-two specialist physicians developed and reviewed 2,069 open-ended Q&A items aligned with these criteria, spanning 26 clinical departments to simulate real-world scenarios. Benchmark testing of six LLMs revealed moderate overall performance (average total score 57.2%, safety 54.7%, effectiveness 62.3%), with a significant 13.3% performance drop in high-risk scenarios (p < 0.0001). Domain-specific medical LLMs showed consistent performance advantages over general-purpose models, with relatively higher top scores in safety (0.912) and effectiveness (0.861). The findings of this study not only provide a standardized metric for evaluating the clinical application of medical LLMs, facilitating comparative analyses, risk exposure identification, and improvement directions across different scenarios, but also hold the potential to promote safer and more effective deployment of large language models in healthcare environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reviewing Clinical Knowledge in Medical Large Language Models: Training and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20988v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large-scale development of large language models (LLMs) in medical contexts, such as diagnostic assistance and treatment recommendations, necessitates that these models possess accurate medical knowledge and deliver traceable decision-making processes. Clinical knowledge, encompassing the insights gained from research on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases, has been extensively examined within real-world medical practices. Recently, there has been a notable increase in research efforts aimed at integrating this type of knowledge into LLMs, encompassing not only traditional text and multimodal data integration but also technologies such as knowledge graphs (KGs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we review the various initiatives to embed clinical knowledge into training-based, KG-supported, and RAG-assisted LLMs. We begin by gathering reliable knowledge sources from the medical domain, including databases and datasets. Next, we evaluate implementations for integrating clinical knowledge through specialized datasets and collaborations with external knowledge sources such as KGs and relevant documentation. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of the developed medical LLMs in the industrial sector to assess the disparity between models developed in academic settings and those in industry. We conclude the survey by presenting evaluation systems applicable to relevant tasks and identifying potential challenges facing this field. In this review, we do not aim for completeness, since any ostensibly complete review would soon be outdated. Our goal is to illustrate diversity by selecting representative and accessible items from current research and industry practices, reflecting real-world situations rather than claiming completeness. Thus, we emphasize showcasing diverse approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Knowledge-Based Systems.

However, their reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce PersianMedQA, a large-scale dataset of 20,785 expert-validated multiple-choice Persian medical questions from 14 years of Iranian national medical exams, spanning 23 medical specialties and designed to evaluate LLMs in both Persian and English. We benchmark 40 state-of-the-art models, including general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving 83.09% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 34.9% in Persian), often struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is generally higher, 3-10% of questions can only be answered correctly in Persian due to cultural and clinical contextual cues that are lost in translation. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating bilingual and culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset is available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA .</p></details> |  |

However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to evaluating AI in healthcare.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical multimodal research.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing medical LLMs struggle with the deep reasoning required for complex medical problems, such as differential diagnosis and medication recommendations. We propose FineMedLM-o1, which leverages high-quality medical synthetic data and long-form reasoning data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling advanced dialogue and deep reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we introduce Test-Time Training (TTT) in the medical domain for the first time, facilitating domain adaptation and ensuring reliable, accurate reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that FineMedLM-o1 achieves a 23% average performance improvement over prior models on key medical benchmarks. Furthermore, the introduction of TTT provides an additional 14% performance boost, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing medical reasoning capabilities. To support this process, we also propose a novel method for synthesizing medical dialogue. Compared to other open-source datasets, our dataset stands out as superior in both quality and complexity. The project and data will be released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, in this work, we adapt the existing concept of reasoning behaviour and articulate its interpretation within the specific context of medical LLMs. We survey and categorise current state-of-the-art approaches for modeling and evaluating reasoning reasoning in medical LLMs. Additionally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. We also outline key open challenges facing the development of Large Reasoning Models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided, enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

This paper presents Secure IVSHMEM, a protocol that provides end-to-end mutual authentication and fine-grained access enforcement with negligible performance cost. We combine three techniques to ensure security: (1) channel separation and kernel module access control, (2)hypervisor-mediated handshake for end-to-end service authentication, and (3)application-level integration for abstraction and performance mitigation. In microbenchmarks, Secure IVSHMEM completes its one-time handshake in under 200ms and sustains data-plane round-trip latencies within 5\% of the unmodified baseline, with negligible bandwidth overhead. We believe this design is ideally suited for safety and latency-critical in-host domains, such as automotive systems, where both performance and security are paramount.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

This work addresses a distributed setting where agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as selective information from others. Specifically, we introduce a distributed online gradient descent method that optimizes local AMs at different agents through communication over routing trees. Our theoretical analysis establishes sublinear regret guarantees, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed protocol consistently outperforms existing online optimization baselines.</p></details> |  |

PRIME first employs a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation}, \textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and \textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Cross-Linguistic Analysis of Memory Load in Sentence Comprehension: Linear Distance and Structural Density](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20916v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability; current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures (Figure 2 has 3 sub-divisions)</p></details> |

To complete many common tasks, relevant objects are required to pass in and out of a robot's field of view. In these settings, spatial memory - the ability to remember the spatial composition of the scene - is an important competency. However, building such mechanisms into robot learning systems remains an open research problem. We introduce mindmap (Spatial Memory in Deep Feature Maps for 3D Action Policies), a 3D diffusion policy that generates robot trajectories based on a semantic 3D reconstruction of the environment. We show in simulation experiments that our approach is effective at solving tasks where state-of-the-art approaches without memory mechanisms struggle.

Existing methods typically depend on vector retrieval and hierarchical storage, yet they are prone to noise accumulation, uncontrolled memory expansion, and limited generalization across domains. To address these challenges, we present SEDM, Self-Evolving Distributed Memory, a verifiable and adaptive framework that transforms memory from a passive repository into an active, self-optimizing component. SEDM integrates verifiable write admission based on reproducible replay, a self-scheduling memory controller that dynamically ranks and consolidates entries according to empirical utility, and cross-domain knowledge diffusion that abstracts reusable insights to support transfer across heterogeneous tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEDM improves reasoning accuracy while reducing token overhead compared with strong memory baselines, and further enables knowledge distilled from fact verification to enhance multi-hop reasoning. The results highlight SEDM as a scalable and sustainable memory mechanism for open-ended multi-agent collaboration. The code will be released in the later stage of this project.</p></details> |  |
| **[UltraEdit: Training-, Subject-, and Memory-Free Lifelong Editing in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14679v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose UltraEdit, a training-, subject-, and memory-free approach that is well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing. UltraEdit fundamentally differs from traditional paradigms by computing parameter shifts in one step using only a hidden state and its gradient, making the approach simple yet efficient. To improve scalability in lifelong settings, UltraEdit employs a lifelong normalization strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. UltraEdit achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art method, which was also the fastest known approach, while using less than 1/4 the VRAM. This makes it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a 24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct UltraEditBench, the largest dataset in the field to date with over 2M editing pairs, and demonstrate that our method supports up to 2M edits while maintaining high accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets and six models show that UltraEdit consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing scenarios, taking a further step towards safe and scalable lifelong learning.

| **[MLP Memory: A Retriever-Pretrained Memory for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01832v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern approaches to enhancing Large Language Models' factual accuracy and knowledge utilization face a fundamental trade-off: non-parametric retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides flexible access to external knowledge but suffers from high inference latency and shallow integration, while parametric fine-tuning methods like LoRA risk catastrophic forgetting and degraded general capabilities. In this work, we propose MLP Memory, a lightweight parametric module that learns to internalize retrieval patterns without explicit document access. By pretraining an MLP to imitate a $k$NN retriever's behavior on the entire pretraining dataset, we create a differentiable memory component that captures the benefits of retrieval-based knowledge access in a fully parametric form. Our architecture integrates this pretrained MLP Memory with Transformer decoders through simple probability interpolation, achieving 12.3\% relative improvement on five question-answering benchmarks and 5.2 points absolute gain across nine general NLP tasks, while reducing hallucinations by up to 10 points on HaluEval. Moreover, MLP Memory delivers 2.5$\times$ faster inference than RAG with superior accuracy. Our findings show that learning retrieval patterns parametrically bridges the gap between efficient inference and effective knowledge access, offering a practical alternative to both RAG and fine-tuning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Memory in LLM Agents via Incremental Multi-Turn Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05257v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, based on classic theories from memory science and cognitive science, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and selective forgetting. Existing benchmarks either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Moreover, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. We introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark transforms existing long-context datasets and incorporates newly constructed datasets into a multi-turn format, effectively simulating the incremental information processing characteristic of memory agents. By carefully selecting and curating datasets, our benchmark provides comprehensive coverage of the four core memory competencies outlined above, thereby offering a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Y.

While recent vision-language model (VLM) based zero-shot approaches reduce dependence on prior maps and scene-specific training data, they face significant limitations: spatiotemporal discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations, and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new evaluation metric (AORI) to assess navigation intelligence better. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DORAEMON's effectiveness in zero-shot autonomous navigation without requiring prior map building or pre-training.</p></details> |  |

| **[From GPUs to RRAMs: Distributed In-Memory Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Solving Large-Scale Linear Optimization Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21137v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of computational workloads is surpassing the capabilities of conventional architectures, which are constrained by fundamental limits. In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Article (12 Pages, 3 Figures), Appendix (4 Pages)</p></details> |
| **[Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21112v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (double column), 4 figures, the short version is to be submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)</p></details> |
| **[The Lifecycle Principle: Stabilizing Dynamic Neural Networks with State Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02575v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge: severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness. Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for achieving these gains.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |
| **[MTRDrive: Memory-Tool Synergistic Reasoning for Robust Autonomous Driving in Corner Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20843v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive decision-making. MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits. This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously evaluate zero-shot generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach. On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\% and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more reliable systems.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Distributed-memory Algorithms for Sparse Matrix Permutation, Extraction, and Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20776v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present scalable distributed-memory algorithms for sparse matrix permutation, extraction, and assignment. Our methods follow an Identify-Exchange-Build (IEB) strategy where each process identifies the local nonzeros to be sent, exchanges the required data, and then builds its local submatrix from the received elements. This approach reduces communication compared to SpGEMM-based methods in distributed memory. By employing synchronization-free multithreaded algorithms, we further accelerate local computations, achieving substantially better performance than existing libraries such as CombBLAS and PETSc. We design efficient software for these operations and evaluate their performance on two university clusters and the Perlmutter supercomputer. Our experiments span a variety of application scenarios, including matrix permutation for load balancing, matrix reordering, subgraph extraction, and streaming graph applications. In all cases, we compare our algorithms against CombBLAS, the most comprehensive distributed library for these operations, and, in some scenarios, against PETSc. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive study of algorithms, software implementations, experimental evaluations, and applications for sparse matrix permutation, extraction, and assignment.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[Meta-Memory: Retrieving and Integrating Semantic-Spatial Memories for Robot Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20754v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge. While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model (LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios. Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

| **[Reliability Analysis of Fully Homomorphic Encryption Systems Under Memory Faults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20686v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) represents a paradigm shift in cryptography, enabling computation directly on encrypted data and unlocking privacy-critical computation. Despite being increasingly deployed in real platforms, the reliability aspects of FHE systems, especially how they respond to faults, have been mostly neglected. This paper aims to better understand of how FHE computation behaves in the presence of memory faults, both in terms of individual operations as well as at the level of applications, for different FHE schemes. Finally, we investigate how effective traditional and FHE-specific fault mitigation techniques are.</p></details> |  |
