| **[One Hand to Rule Them All: Canonical Representations for Unified Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16712v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous manipulation policies today largely assume fixed hand designs, severely restricting their generalization to new embodiments with varied kinematic and structural layouts. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a parameterized canonical representation that unifies a broad spectrum of dexterous hand architectures. It comprises a unified parameter space and a canonical URDF format, offering three key advantages. 1) The parameter space captures essential morphological and kinematic variations for effective conditioning in learning algorithms. 2) A structured latent manifold can be learned over our space, where interpolations between embodiments yield smooth and physically meaningful morphology transitions. 3) The canonical URDF standardizes the action space while preserving dynamic and functional properties of the original URDFs, enabling efficient and reliable cross-embodiment policy learning. We validate these advantages through extensive analysis and experiments, including grasp policy replay, VAE latent encoding, and cross-embodiment zero-shot transfer. Specifically, we train a VAE on the unified representation to obtain a compact, semantically rich latent embedding, and develop a grasping policy conditioned on the canonical representation that generalizes across dexterous hands. We demonstrate, through simulation and real-world tasks on unseen morphologies (e.g., 81.9% zero-shot success rate on 3-finger LEAP Hand), that our framework unifies both the representational and action spaces of structurally diverse hands, providing a scalable foundation for cross-hand learning toward universal dexterous manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zhenyuwei2003.github.io/OHRA/</p></details> |
| **[VIGOR: Visual Goal-In-Context Inference for Unified Humanoid Fall Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16511v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable fall recovery is critical for humanoids operating in cluttered environments. Unlike quadrupeds or wheeled robots, humanoids experience high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes during a fall, making recovery essential for continued operation. Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems such as fall avoidance, impact mitigation, and stand-up recovery, or rely on end-to-end policies trained without vision through reinforcement learning or imitation learning, often on flat terrain. At a deeper level, fall safety is treated as monolithic data complexity, coupling pose, dynamics, and terrain and requiring exhaustive coverage, limiting scalability and generalization. We present a unified fall safety approach that spans all phases of fall recovery. It builds on two insights: 1) Natural human fall and recovery poses are highly constrained and transferable from flat to complex terrain through alignment, and 2) Fast whole-body reactions require integrated perceptual-motor representations. We train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, and distill it into a deployable student that relies only on egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns how to react by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation, which combines the next target pose with the local terrain, rather than separately encoding what it must perceive and how it must act. Results in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments without real-world fine-tuning.

| **[OmniCT: Towards a Unified Slice-Volume LVLM for Comprehensive CT Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16110v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used and diagnostically information-dense imaging modalities, covering critical organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and colon. Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[SVD Incidence Centrality: A Unified Spectral Framework for Node and Edge Analysis in Directed Networks and Hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15736v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying influential nodes and edges in directed networks remains a fundamental challenge across domains from social influence to biological regulation. Most existing centrality measures face a critical limitation: they either discard directional information through symmetrization or produce sparse, implementation-dependent rankings that obscure structural importance. We introduce a unified spectral framework for centrality analysis in directed networks grounded in the Singular value decomposition of the incidence matrix. The proposed approach derives both vertex and edge centralities via the pseudoinverse of Hodge Laplacians, yielding dense and well-resolved rankings that overcome the sparsity limitations commonly observed in betweenness centrality for directed graphs. Unlike traditional measures that require graph symmetrization, our framework naturally preserves directional information, enabling principled hub/authority analysis while maintaining mathematical consistency through spectral graph theory. The method extends naturally to hypergraphs through the same mathematical foundation. Experimental validation on real-world networks demonstrates the framework's effectiveness across diverse domains where traditional centrality measures encounter limitations due to implementation dependencies and sparse outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A unified theory of feature learning in RNNs and DNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15593v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent and deep neural networks (RNNs/DNNs) are cornerstone architectures in machine learning. Remarkably, RNNs differ from DNNs only by weight sharing, as can be shown through unrolling in time. How does this structural similarity fit with the distinct functional properties these networks exhibit? To address this question, we here develop a unified mean-field theory for RNNs and DNNs in terms of representational kernels, describing fully trained networks in the feature learning ($μ$P) regime. This theory casts training as Bayesian inference over sequences and patterns, directly revealing the functional implications induced by the RNNs' weight sharing. In DNN-typical tasks, we identify a phase transition when the learning signal overcomes the noise due to randomness in the weights: below this threshold, RNNs and DNNs behave identically; above it, only RNNs develop correlated representations across timesteps. For sequential tasks, the RNNs' weight sharing furthermore induces an inductive bias that aids generalization by interpolating unsupervised time steps. Overall, our theory offers a way to connect architectural structure to functional biases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni-Flow: a unified autoregressive-diffusion model for complex multiscale flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15592v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal flows govern diverse phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, yet modelling their multiscale dynamics remains a central challenge. Despite major advances in physics-informed machine learning, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously maintain long-term temporal evolution and resolve fine-scale structure across chaotic, turbulent, and physiological regimes. Here, we introduce Uni-Flow, a unified autoregressive-diffusion framework that explicitly separates temporal evolution from spatial refinement for modelling complex dynamical systems. The autoregressive component learns low-resolution latent dynamics that preserve large-scale structure and ensure stable long-horizon rollouts, while the diffusion component reconstructs high-resolution physical fields, recovering fine-scale features in a small number of denoising steps. We validate Uni-Flow across canonical benchmarks, including two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, three-dimensional turbulent channel inflow generation with a quantum-informed autoregressive prior, and patient-specific simulations of aortic coarctation derived from high-fidelity lattice Boltzmann hemodynamic solvers. In the cardiovascular setting, Uni-Flow enables task-level faster than real-time inference of pulsatile hemodynamics, reconstructing high-resolution pressure fields over physiologically relevant time horizons in seconds rather than hours. By transforming high-fidelity hemodynamic simulation from an offline, HPC-bound process into a deployable surrogate, Uni-Flow establishes a pathway to faster-than-real-time modelling of complex multiscale flows, with broad implications for scientific machine learning in flow physics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Evaluation of Learning-Based Similarity Techniques for Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15376v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryptographic digests (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) are designed to provide exact identity. Any single-bit change in the input produces a completely different hash, which is ideal for integrity verification but limits their usefulness in many real-world tasks like threat hunting, malware analysis and digital forensics, where adversaries routinely introduce minor transformations. Similarity-based techniques address this limitation by enabling approximate matching, allowing related byte sequences to produce measurably similar fingerprints. Modern enterprises manage tens of thousands of endpoints with billions of files, making the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed techniques more important than ever in security applications. Security researchers have proposed a range of approaches, including similarity digests and locality-sensitive hashes (e.g., ssdeep, sdhash, TLSH), as well as more recent machine-learning-based methods that generate embeddings from file features. However, these techniques have largely been evaluated in isolation, using disparate datasets and evaluation criteria. This paper presents a systematic comparison of learning-based classification and similarity methods using large, publicly available datasets. We evaluate each method under a unified experimental framework with industry-accepted metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first reproducible study to benchmark these diverse learning-based similarity techniques side by side for real-world security workloads. Our results show that no single approach performs well across all dimensions; instead, each exhibits distinct trade-offs, indicating that effective malware analysis and threat-hunting platforms must combine complementary classification and similarity techniques rather than rely on a single method.</p></details> |  |
| **[BindCLIP: A Unified Contrastive-Generative Representation Learning Framework for Virtual Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15236v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual screening aims to efficiently identify active ligands from massive chemical libraries for a given target pocket. Recent CLIP-style models such as DrugCLIP enable scalable virtual screening by embedding pockets and ligands into a shared space. However, our analyses indicate that such representations can be insensitive to fine-grained binding interactions and may rely on shortcut correlations in training data, limiting their ability to rank ligands by true binding compatibility. To address these issues, we propose BindCLIP, a unified contrastive-generative representation learning framework for virtual screening. BindCLIP jointly trains pocket and ligand encoders using CLIP-style contrastive learning together with a pocket-conditioned diffusion objective for binding pose generation, so that pose-level supervision directly shapes the retrieval embedding space toward interaction-relevant features. To further mitigate shortcut reliance, we introduce hard-negative augmentation and a ligand-ligand anchoring regularizer that prevents representation collapse. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. BindCLIP achieves substantial gains on challenging out-of-distribution virtual screening and improves ligand-analogue ranking on the FEP+ benchmark. Together, these results indicate that integrating generative, pose-level supervision with contrastive learning yields more interaction-aware embeddings and improves generalization in realistic screening settings, bringing virtual screening closer to real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating the Real World: A Unified Survey of Multimodal Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04641v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository for the related papers at https://github.com/ALEEEHU/World-Simulator</p></details> |
| **[Thermal Min-Max Games: Unifying Bounded Rationality and Typical-Case Equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14858v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strategic-form min-max game theory examines the existence, multiplicity, selection of equilibria, and the worst-case computational complexity under perfect rationality. However, in many applications, games are drawn from an ensemble, and players exhibit bounded rationality. We introduce thermal min-max games, a thermodynamic relaxation that unifies bounded and perfect rationality by assigning each player a temperature to regulate their rationality level. To analyze typical behavior in the large-strategy limit, we develop a nested replica framework for this relaxation. This theory provides tractable predictions for typical equilibrium values and mixed-strategy statistics as functions of rationality strength, strategy-count aspect ratio, and payoff randomness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that these asymptotic predictions accurately align with the equilibrium of finite games of moderate size.</p></details> | 31 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Unified Mathematical Framework for Distributed Data Fabrics: Categorical Hypergraph Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14708v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current distributed data fabrics lack a rigorous mathematical foundation, often relying on ad-hoc architectures that struggle with consistency, lineage, and scale. We propose a mathematical framework for data fabrics, unifying heterogeneous data management in distributed systems through a hypergraph-based structure \( \mathcal{F} = (D, M, G, T, P, A) \). Datasets, metadata, transformations, policies, and analytics are modeled over a distributed system \( Σ= (N, C) \), with multi-way relationships encoded in a hypergraph \( G = (V, E) \). A categorical approach, with datasets as objects and transformations as morphisms, supports operations like data integration and federated learning. The hypergraph is embedded into a modular tensor category, capturing relational symmetries via braided monoidal structures, with geometric analogies to Hurwitz spaces enriching the algebraic modeling. We prove the NP-hardness of critical tasks, such as schema matching and dynamic partitioning, and propose spectral methods and symmetry-based alignments for scalable solutions. The framework ensures consistency, completeness, and causality under CAP and CAL theorems, leveraging sparse incidence matrices and braiding actions for fault-tolerant operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoRL: Reinforced Reasoning for Unified Motion Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14534v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion understanding and generation are crucial for vision and robotics but remain limited in reasoning capability and test-time planning. We propose MoRL, a unified multimodal motion model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our task-specific reward design combines semantic alignment and reasoning coherence for understanding with physical plausibility and text-motion consistency for generation, improving both logical reasoning and perceptual realism. To further enhance inference, we introduce Chain-of-Motion (CoM), a test-time reasoning method that enables step-by-step planning and reflection. We also construct two large-scale CoT datasets, MoUnd-CoT-140K and MoGen-CoT-140K, to align motion sequences with reasoning traces and action descriptions. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that MoRL achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/MoRL.

| **[D-SECURE: Dual-Source Evidence Combination for Unified Reasoning in Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14441v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation increasingly mixes realistic im-age edits with fluent but misleading text, producing persuasive posts that are difficult to verify. Existing systems usually rely on a single evidence source. Content-based detectors identify local inconsistencies within an image and its caption but cannot determine global factual truth. Retrieval-based fact-checkers reason over external evidence but treat inputs as coarse claims and often miss subtle visual or textual manipulations. This separation creates failure cases where internally consistent fabrications bypass manipulation detectors and fact-checkers verify claims that contain pixel-level or token-level corruption. We present D-SECURE, a framework that combines internal manipulation detection with external evidence-based reasoning for news-style posts. D-SECURE integrates the HAMMER manipulation detector with the DEFAME retrieval pipeline. DEFAME performs broad verification, and HAMMER analyses residual or uncertain cases that may contain fine-grained edits. Experiments on DGM4 and ClaimReview samples highlight the complementary strengths of both systems and motivate their fusion. We provide a unified, explainable report that incorporates manipulation cues and external evidence.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[A unified framework for evaluating the robustness of machine-learning interpretability for prospect risking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14430v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In geophysics, hydrocarbon prospect risking involves assessing the risks associated with hydrocarbon exploration by integrating data from various sources. Machine learning-based classifiers trained on tabular data have been recently used to make faster decisions on these prospects. The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of such models has led to the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). LIME and SHAP are two such examples of these XAI methods which try to generate explanations of a particular decision by ranking the input features in terms of importance. However, explanations of the same scenario generated by these two different explanation strategies have shown to disagree or be different, particularly for complex data. This is because the definitions of "importance" and "relevance" differ for different explanation strategies. Thus, grounding these ranked features using theoretically backed causal ideas of necessity and sufficiency can prove to be a more reliable and robust way to improve the trustworthiness of the concerned explanation strategies.We propose a unified framework to generate counterfactuals as well as quantify necessity and sufficiency and use these to perform a robustness evaluation of the explanations provided by LIME and SHAP on high dimensional structured prospect risking data. This robustness test gives us deeper insights into the models capabilities to handle erronous data and which XAI module works best in pair with which model for our dataset for hydorcarbon indication.</p></details> |  |

The design includes a custom sparsity-aware near-memory circuit providing about 1.5 times energy savings, and a lightweight softmax circuit providing about 1.6 times energy savings. The architecture supports reconfigurable compute up to INT16 with dynamic resolution updates and scales efficiently across problem sizes. ABI-enabled MI300 and Blackwell systems achieve about 4.5 times speedup over baseline MI300 and Blackwell.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Debate: A Unified Agentic Framework for Tabular Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14251v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular anomaly detection is often handled by single detectors or static ensembles, even though strong performance on tabular data typically comes from heterogeneous model families (e.g., tree ensembles, deep tabular networks, and tabular foundation models) that frequently disagree under distribution shift, missingness, and rare-anomaly regimes. We propose MAD, a Multi-Agent Debating framework that treats this disagreement as a first-class signal and resolves it through a mathematically grounded coordination layer. Each agent is a machine learning (ML)-based detector that produces a normalized anomaly score, confidence, and structured evidence, augmented by a large language model (LLM)-based critic. A coordinator converts these messages into bounded per-agent losses and updates agent influence via an exponentiated-gradient rule, yielding both a final debated anomaly score and an auditable debate trace. MAD is a unified agentic framework that can recover existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts gating and learning-with-expert-advice aggregation, by restricting the message space and synthesis operator. We establish regret guarantees for the synthesized losses and show how conformal calibration can wrap the debated score to control false positives under exchangeability. Experiments on diverse tabular anomaly benchmarks show improved robustness over baselines and clearer traces of model disagreement</p></details> |  |
| **[UniWeTok: An Unified Binary Tokenizer with Codebook Size $\mathit{2^{128}}$ for Unified Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14178v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require a visual representation that simultaneously supports high-fidelity reconstruction, complex semantic extraction, and generative suitability. However, existing visual tokenizers typically struggle to satisfy these conflicting objectives within a single framework. In this paper, we introduce UniWeTok, a unified discrete tokenizer designed to bridge this gap using a massive binary codebook ($\mathit{2^{128}}$). For training framework, we introduce Pre-Post Distillation and a Generative-Aware Prior to enhance the semantic extraction and generative prior of the discrete tokens. In terms of model architecture, we propose a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with the SigLu activation function. SigLu activation not only bounds the encoder output and stabilizes the semantic distillation process but also effectively addresses the optimization conflict between token entropy loss and commitment loss. We further propose a three-stage training framework designed to enhance UniWeTok's adaptability cross various image resolutions and perception-sensitive scenarios, such as those involving human faces and textual content. On ImageNet, UniWeTok achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance (FID: UniWeTok 1.38 vs. REPA 1.42) while requiring a remarkably low training compute (Training Tokens: UniWeTok 33B vs. REPA 262B). On general-domain, UniWeTok demonstrates highly competitive capabilities across a broad range of tasks, including multimodal understanding, image generation (DPG Score: UniWeTok 86.63 vs. FLUX.1 [Dev] 83.84), and editing (GEdit Overall Score: UniWeTok 5.09 vs. OmniGen 5.06). We release code and models to facilitate community exploration of unified tokenizer and MLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures, 33 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose LaViDa-R1, a multimodal, general-purpose reasoning dLLM. Unlike existing works that build reasoning dLLMs through task-specific reinforcement learning, LaViDa-R1 incorporates diverse multimodal understanding and generation tasks in a unified manner. In particular, LaViDa-R1 is built with a novel unified post-training framework that seamlessly integrates supervised finetuning (SFT) and multi-task reinforcement learning (RL). It employs several novel training techniques, including answer-forcing, tree search, and complementary likelihood estimation, to enhance effectiveness and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate LaViDa-R1's strong performance on a wide range of multimodal tasks, including visual math reasoning, reason-intensive grounding, and image editing.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |

UGround addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues (\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer, MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise (empty target).

In real-world deployments, forecasting models must operate under structural and observational uncertainties, conditions that are rarely considered in model design. Recent approaches achieve strong short-term predictive performance by tightly coupling spatial and temporal modeling, often at the cost of increased complexity and limited modularity. In contrast, efficient time-series models capture long-range temporal dependencies without relying on explicit network structure. We propose UniST-Pred, a unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that first decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, then integrates both through adaptive representation-level fusion. To assess robustness of the proposed approach, we construct a dataset based on an agent-based, microscopic traffic simulator (MATSim) and evaluate UniST-Pred under severe network disconnection scenarios. Additionally, we benchmark UniST-Pred on standard traffic prediction datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against existing well-established models despite a lightweight design. The results illustrate that UniST-Pred maintains strong predictive performance across both real-world and simulated datasets, while also yielding interpretable spatio-temporal representations under infrastructure disruptions. The source code and the generated dataset are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UniST-Pred-EF27</p></details> |  |

As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.</p></details> |  |

However, transforming raw videos into high-quality, task-specific datasets remains costly and inefficient. We present DataCube, an intelligent platform for automatic video processing, multi-dimensional profiling, and query-driven retrieval. DataCube constructs structured semantic representations of video clips and supports hybrid retrieval with neural re-ranking and deep semantic matching.

| **[EventMemAgent: Hierarchical Event-Centric Memory for Online Video Understanding with Adaptive Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15329v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent.</p></details> |  |

Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs. Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics. Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Signal Adaptive KV-Cache Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14236v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a critical memory bottleneck when processing long-form video content due to the linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache with sequence length. Existing solutions predominantly employ reactive eviction strategies that compute full attention matrices before discarding tokens, resulting in substantial computational waste. We propose Sali-Cache, a novel a priori optimization framework that implements dual-signal adaptive caching through proactive memory management. By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics. Furthermore, under identical memory budget constraints, Sali-Cache preserves context-rich features over extended temporal durations without degrading model performance, enabling efficient processing of long-form video content on consumer-grade hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[A generalizable foundation model for intraoperative understanding across surgical procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13633v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In minimally invasive surgery, clinical decisions depend on real-time visual interpretation, yet intraoperative perception varies substantially across surgeons and procedures. This variability limits consistent assessment, training, and the development of reliable artificial intelligence systems, as most surgical AI models are designed for narrowly defined tasks and do not generalize across procedures or institutions. Here we introduce ZEN, a generalizable foundation model for intraoperative surgical video understanding trained on more than 4 million frames from over 21 procedures using a self-supervised multi-teacher distillation framework. We curated a large and diverse dataset and systematically evaluated multiple representation learning strategies within a unified benchmark. Across 20 downstream tasks and full fine-tuning, frozen-backbone, few-shot and zero-shot settings, ZEN consistently outperforms existing surgical foundation models and demonstrates robust cross-procedure generalization. These results suggest a step toward unified representations for surgical scene understanding and support future applications in intraoperative assistance and surgical training assessment.</p></details> |  |

Instead of uniformly sampling frames, \revise selects a small set of informative frames, maintains a summary-as-state across rounds, and stops early when confident. It supports proprietary vision-language models (VLMs) in a ``plug-and-play'' setting and enables reinforcement fine-tuning for open-source models. For fine-tuning, we introduce EAGER (Evidence-Adjusted Gain for Efficient Reasoning), an annotation-free reward with three terms: (1) Confidence gain: after new frames are added, we reward the increase in the log-odds gap between the correct option and the strongest alternative; (2) Summary sufficiency: at answer time we re-ask using only the last committed summary and reward success; (3) Correct-and-early stop: answering correctly within a small turn budget is rewarded. Across multiple VQA benchmarks, \revise improves accuracy while reducing frames, rounds, and prompt tokens, demonstrating practical sparse video reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniVideoBench: Towards Audio-Visual Understanding Evaluation for Omni MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10689v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization, counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoPE-VideoLM: Codec Primitives For Efficient Video Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13191v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Language Models (VideoLMs) empower AI systems to understand temporal dynamics in videos. To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\%$ and token usage by up to $93\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sayands.github.io/cope/</p></details> |

However, the performance of existing models is primarily constrained by video-instruction data that represents complex audiovisual content as single, incomplete descriptions, lacking fine-grained organization and reliable annotation. To address this, we introduce: (i) ASID-1M, an open-source collection of one million structured, fine-grained audiovisual instruction annotations with single- and multi-attribute supervision; (ii) ASID-Verify, a scalable data curation pipeline for annotation, with automatic verification and refinement that enforces semantic and temporal consistency between descriptions and the corresponding audiovisual content; and (iii) ASID-Captioner, a video understanding model trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the ASID-1M. Experiments across seven benchmarks covering audiovisual captioning, attribute-wise captioning, caption-based QA, and caption-based temporal grounding show that ASID-Captioner improves fine-grained caption quality while reducing hallucinations and improving instruction following. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models and is competitive with Gemini-3-Pro.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://asid-caption.github.io/</p></details> |

This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, akin to chatting with a real person. However, a fundamental mismatch exists between current RTC frameworks and AI Video Assistants, stemming from the drastic shift in Quality of Experience (QoE) and more challenging networks. Measurements on our production prototype also confirm that current RTC fails, causing latency spikes and accuracy drops. To address these challenges, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented RTC framework for MLLM Video Assistants, exploring the shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video." Specifically, Artic proposes: (1) Response Capability-aware Adaptive Bitrate, which utilizes MLLM accuracy saturation to proactively cap bitrate, reserving bandwidth headroom to absorb future fluctuations for latency reduction; (2) Zero-overhead Context-aware Streaming, which allocates limited bitrate to regions most important for the response, maintaining accuracy even under ultra-low bitrates; and (3) Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark, the first benchmark evaluating how RTC-induced video degradation affects MLLM accuracy. Prototype experiments using real-world uplink traces show that compared with existing methods, Artic significantly improves accuracy by 15.12% and reduces latency by 135.31 ms. We will release the benchmark and codes at https://github.com/pku-netvideo/DeViBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fibottention: Inceptive Visual Representation Learning with Diverse Attention Across Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19391v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers and their variants have achieved remarkable success in diverse visual perception tasks. Despite their effectiveness, they suffer from two significant limitations. First, the quadratic computational complexity of multi-head self-attention (MHSA), which restricts scalability to large token counts, and second, a high dependency on large-scale training data to attain competitive performance. In this paper, to address these challenges, we propose a novel sparse self-attention mechanism named Fibottention. Fibottention employs structured sparsity patterns derived from the Wythoff array, enabling an $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ computational complexity in self-attention. By design, its sparsity patterns vary across attention heads, which provably reduces redundant pairwise interactions while ensuring sufficient and diverse coverage. This leads to an \emph{inception-like functional diversity} in the attention heads, and promotes more informative and disentangled representations. We integrate Fibottention into standard Transformer architectures and conduct extensive experiments across multiple domains, including image classification, video understanding, and robot learning. Results demonstrate that models equipped with Fibottention either significantly outperform or achieve on-par performance with their dense MHSA counterparts, while leveraging only $2\%$ of all pairwise interactions across self-attention heads in typical settings, $2-6\%$ of the pairwise interactions in self-attention heads, resulting in substantial computational savings. Moreover, when compared to existing sparse attention mechanisms, Fibottention consistently achieves superior results on a FLOP-equivalency basis. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the enhanced feature diversity resulting from our attention design and discuss its implications for efficient representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The complete implementation, including source code and evaluation scripts, is publicly available at: https://github.com/Charlotte-CharMLab/Fibottention</p></details> |

While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abhis...</summary><p>Abhishek Vijaya Kumar and Bhaskar Kataria have equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[Corruption-Aware Training of Latent Video Diffusion Models for Robust Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21545v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative quality for image and video generation; however, they remain brittle under noisy conditioning, where small perturbations in text or multimodal embeddings can cascade over timesteps and cause semantic drift. Existing corruption strategies from image diffusion (e.g., Gaussian, Uniform) fail in video settings because static noise disrupts temporal fidelity. In this paper, we propose CAT-LVDM, a corruption-aware training framework with structured, data-aligned noise injection tailored for video diffusion. Our two operators, Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI) and Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), align perturbations with batch semantics or spectral dynamics to preserve coherence. CAT-LVDM yields substantial gains: BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9 percent on WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN improves UCF-101 by 12.3 percent, outperforming Gaussian, Uniform, and large diffusion baselines such as DEMO (2.3B) and LaVie (3B) despite training on 5x less data. Ablations confirm the unique value of low-rank, data-aligned noise, and theoretical analysis establishes why these operators tighten robustness and generalization bounds. CAT-LVDM thus introduces a principled framework for robust video diffusion and further demonstrates transferability to autoregressive generation and multimodal video understanding models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/chikap421/catlvdm</p></details> |
| **[MedScope: Incentivizing "Think with Videos" for Clinical Reasoning via Coarse-to-Fine Tool Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13332v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form clinical videos are central to visual evidence-based decision-making, with growing importance for applications such as surgical robotics and related settings. However, current multimodal large language models typically process videos with passive sampling or weakly grounded inspection, which limits their ability to iteratively locate, verify, and justify predictions with temporally targeted evidence. To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite. We then optimize MedScope with Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO), which directly reinforces tool use with grounding-aligned rewards and evidence-weighted advantages. On full and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, MedScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely "think with videos" through tool-integrated reasoning. We will release our code, models, and data.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoSTF: Stress-Testing Output Repetition in Video Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10639v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at: https://github.com/yuxincao22/VideoSTF_benchmark.</p></details> |  |

In streaming video scenarios, the primary bottleneck lies in the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoding stage, where redundant processing of temporally similar frames leads to inefficiency. Additionally, inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling further exacerbate latency and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{S}treaming \textbf{T}oken \textbf{C}ompression (\textbf{STC}), a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that seamlessly integrates into existing streaming VideoLLMs, optimizing both ViT encoding and LLM pre-filling stages to accelerate processing. STC introduces two token-level accelerators: \textbf{STC-Cacher}, which reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and \textbf{STC-Pruner}, which compresses the visual token sequence before it enters the LLM, preserving only the most salient tokens based on both spatial and temporal relevance. Extensive experiments on four baseline streaming VideoLLMs across five benchmarks demonstrate that STC outperforms other compression methods. Notably, STC retains up to \textbf{99\%} of accuracy on the ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency and LLM pre-filling latency by \textbf{24.5\%} and \textbf{45.3\%}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is avaliable at \url{https://github.com/lern-to-write/STC}</p></details> |

Unlike generic activity recognition, collaborative manipulation requires sub-task labels that are directly robot-executable. We present RoboSubtaskNet, a multi-stage human-to-robot sub-task segmentation framework that couples attention-enhanced I3D features (RGB plus optical flow) with a modified MS-TCN employing a Fibonacci dilation schedule to capture better short-horizon transitions such as reach-pick-place. The network is trained with a composite objective comprising cross-entropy and temporal regularizers (truncated MSE and a transition-aware term) to reduce over-segmentation and to encourage valid sub-task progressions. To close the gap between vision benchmarks and control, we introduce RoboSubtask, a dataset of healthcare and industrial demonstrations annotated at the sub-task level and designed for deterministic mapping to manipulator primitives. Empirically, RoboSubtaskNet outperforms MS-TCN and MS-TCN++ on GTEA and our RoboSubtask benchmark (boundary-sensitive and sequence metrics), while remaining competitive on the long-horizon Breakfast benchmark. Specifically, RoboSubtaskNet attains F1 @ 50 = 79.5%, Edit = 88.6%, Acc = 78.9% on GTEA; F1 @ 50 = 30.4%, Edit = 52.0%, Acc = 53.5% on Breakfast; and F1 @ 50 = 94.2%, Edit = 95.6%, Acc = 92.2% on RoboSubtask. We further validate the full perception-to-execution pipeline on a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator, achieving reliable end-to-end behavior in physical trials (overall task success approx 91.25%). These results demonstrate a practical path from sub-task level video understanding to deployed robotic manipulation in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

Yet little is known about how to design and integrate multi-robot videos into public safety workflows. Collaborating with six police agencies, we examined how such videos could be made practical. In Study 1, we presented the first testbed for multi-robot ground video sensemaking. The testbed includes 38 events-of-interest (EoI) relevant to public safety, a dataset of 20 robot patrol videos (10 day/night pairs) covering EoI types, and 6 design requirements aimed at improving current video sensemaking practices. In Study 2, we built MRVS, a tool that augments multi-robot patrol video streams with a prompt-engineered video understanding model. Participants reported reduced manual workload and greater confidence with LLM-based explanations, while noting concerns about false alarms and privacy. We conclude with implications for designing future multi-robot video sensemaking tools.</p></details> |  |

Current models often struggle with these videos because existing benchmarks focus primarily on general-purpose tasks and neglect the reasoning of commercial intent. In this work, we first propose a multi-modal information density assessment framework to quantify the complexity of this domain. Our evaluation reveals that e-commerce content exhibits substantially higher density across visual, audio, and textual modalities compared to mainstream datasets, establishing a more challenging frontier for video understanding. To address this gap, we introduce E-commerce Video Ads Benchmark (E-VAds), which is the first benchmark specifically designed for e-commerce short video understanding. We curated 3,961 high-quality videos from Taobao covering a wide range of product categories and used a multi-agent system to generate 19,785 open-ended Q&A pairs. These questions are organized into two primary dimensions, namely Perception and Cognition and Reasoning, which consist of five distinct tasks. Finally, we develop E-VAds-R1, an RL-based reasoning model featuring a multi-grained reward design called MG-GRPO. This strategy provides smooth guidance for early exploration while creating a non-linear incentive for expert-level precision. Experimental results demonstrate that E-VAds-R1 achieves a 109.2% performance gain in commercial intent reasoning with only a few hundred training samples.</p></details> |  |

Existing video representation approaches overly rely on static appearance and scene context rather than motion dynamics, a bias inherited from their training data and objectives. Conversely, traditional motion-centric inputs like optical flow lack the semantic grounding needed to understand high-level motion. To demonstrate this inherent bias, we introduce the SimMotion benchmarks, combining controlled synthetic data with a new human-annotated real-world dataset. We show that existing models perform poorly on these benchmarks, often failing to disentangle motion from appearance. To address this gap, we propose SemanticMoments, a simple, training-free method that computes temporal statistics (specifically, higher-order moments) over features from pre-trained semantic models. Across our benchmarks, SemanticMoments consistently outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods. This demonstrates that temporal statistics in a semantic feature space provide a scalable and perceptually grounded foundation for motion-centric video understanding.</p></details> |  |

To lay the foundation for this assistant, we conducted a comprehensive data collection study where six participants lived together for one week, continuously recording their daily activities - including discussions, shopping, cooking, socializing, and entertainment - using AI glasses for multimodal egocentric video capture, along with synchronized third-person-view video references. This effort resulted in the EgoLife Dataset, a comprehensive 300-hour egocentric, interpersonal, multiview, and multimodal daily life dataset with intensive annotation. Leveraging this dataset, we introduce EgoLifeQA, a suite of long-context, life-oriented question-answering tasks designed to provide meaningful assistance in daily life by addressing practical questions such as recalling past relevant events, monitoring health habits, and offering personalized recommendations. To address the key technical challenges of (1) developing robust visual-audio models for egocentric data, (2) enabling identity recognition, and (3) facilitating long-context question answering over extensive temporal information, we introduce EgoButler, an integrated system comprising EgoGPT and EgoRAG. EgoGPT is an omni-modal model trained on egocentric datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on egocentric video understanding. EgoRAG is a retrieval-based component that supports answering ultra-long-context questions. Our experimental studies verify their working mechanisms and reveal critical factors and bottlenecks, guiding future improvements.

However, Video MLLMs face high computational costs, particularly in processing numerous video frames as input, which leads to significant attention computation overhead. A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames. To preserve video semantics, TiFRe employs a Frame Matching and Merging (FMM) mechanism, which integrates non-key frame information into the selected key frames, minimizing information loss. Experiments show that TiFRe effectively reduces computational costs while improving performance on video-language tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

| **[Learning to unfold cloth: Scaling up world models to deformable object manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16675v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to manipulate cloth is both a paradigmatic problem for robotic research and a problem of immediate relevance to a variety of applications ranging from assistive care to the service industry. The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Language and Experience: A Computational Model of Social Learning in Complex Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00074v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: github.com/ccolas/language_and_experience Demo: cedriccolas.com/demos/language_and_experience</p></details> |
| **[Factored Latent Action World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16229v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Failure Classification and Anomaly Detection for Autonomous Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16182v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous inspection robots for monitoring industrial sites can reduce costs and risks associated with human-led inspection. However, accurate readings can be challenging due to occlusions, limited viewpoints, or unexpected environmental conditions. We propose a hybrid framework that combines supervised failure classification with anomaly detection, enabling classification of inspection tasks as a success, known failure, or anomaly (i.e., out-of-distribution) case. Our approach uses a world model backbone with compressed video inputs. This policy-agnostic, distribution-free framework determines classifications based on two decision functions set by conformal prediction (CP) thresholds before a human observer does. We evaluate the framework on gauge inspection feeds collected from office and industrial sites and demonstrate real-time deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot. Experiments show over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between successes, failures, and OOD cases, with classifications occurring earlier than a human observer. These results highlight the potential for robust, anticipatory failure detection in autonomous inspection tasks or as a feedback signal for model training to assess and improve the quality of training data.

| **[stable-worldmodel-v1: Reproducible World Modeling Research and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08968v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World Models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning compact, predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling agents to reason, plan, and generalize beyond direct experience. Despite recent interest in World Models, most available implementations remain publication-specific, severely limiting their reusability, increasing the risk of bugs, and reducing evaluation standardization. To mitigate these issues, we introduce stable-worldmodel (SWM), a modular, tested, and documented world-model research ecosystem that provides efficient data-collection tools, standardized environments, planning algorithms, and baseline implementations. In addition, each environment in SWM enables controllable factors of variation, including visual and physical properties, to support robustness and continual learning research. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of SWM by using it to study zero-shot robustness in DINO-WM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Horizon Imagination: Efficient On-Policy Rollout in Diffusion World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08032v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study diffusion-based world models for reinforcement learning, which offer high generative fidelity but face critical efficiency challenges in control. Current methods either require heavyweight models at inference or rely on highly sequential imagination, both of which impose prohibitive computational costs. We propose Horizon Imagination (HI), an on-policy imagination process for discrete stochastic policies that denoises multiple future observations in parallel. HI incorporates a stabilization mechanism and a novel sampling schedule that decouples the denoising budget from the effective horizon over which denoising is applied while also supporting sub-frame budgets. Experiments on Atari 100K and Craftium show that our approach maintains control performance with a sub-frame budget of half the denoising steps and achieves superior generation quality under varied schedules. Code is available at https://github.com/leor-c/horizon-imagination.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be published in the ICLR 2026 proceedings</p></details> |
| **[VLM-DEWM: Dynamic External World Model for Verifiable and Resilient Vision-Language Planning in Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15549v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language model (VLM) shows promise for high-level planning in smart manufacturing, yet their deployment in dynamic workcells faces two critical challenges: (1) stateless operation, they cannot persistently track out-of-view states, causing world-state drift; and (2) opaque reasoning, failures are difficult to diagnose, leading to costly blind retries. This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Consistent Video World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07854v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive world models that simulate future observations under explicit camera control are fundamental to interactive AI. Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce \textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency. We also present \textbf{ViewBench}, a diagnostic suite measuring loop-closure fidelity and geometric drift. Our results demonstrate that ViewRope substantially improves long-term consistency while reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[World-Model-Augmented Web Agents with Action Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15384v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web agents based on large language models have demonstrated promising capability in automating web tasks. However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulating the Real World: A Unified Survey of Multimodal Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04641v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and replicating the real world is a critical challenge in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research. To achieve this, many existing approaches, such as world models, aim to capture the fundamental principles governing the physical world, enabling more accurate simulations and meaningful interactions. However, current methods often treat different modalities, including 2D (images), videos, 3D, and 4D representations, as independent domains, overlooking their interdependencies. Additionally, these methods typically focus on isolated dimensions of reality without systematically integrating their connections. In this survey, we present a unified survey for multimodal generative models that investigate the progression of data dimensionality in real-world simulation. Specifically, this survey starts from 2D generation (appearance), then moves to video (appearance+dynamics) and 3D generation (appearance+geometry), and finally culminates in 4D generation that integrate all dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically unify the study of 2D, video, 3D and 4D generation within a single framework. To guide future research, we provide a comprehensive review of datasets, evaluation metrics and future directions, and fostering insights for newcomers. This survey serves as a bridge to advance the study of multimodal generative models and real-world simulation within a unified framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository for the related papers at https://github.com/ALEEEHU/World-Simulator</p></details> |
| **[Cold-Start Personalization via Training-Free Priors from Structured World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15012v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cold-start personalization requires inferring user preferences through interaction when no user-specific historical data is available. The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models in Autonomous Driving: A Survey on Scenario Generation and Scenario Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11526v4)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which contains supplementary materials and is available at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/FM-for-Scenario-Generation-Analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Open Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |
| **[World Models for Policy Refinement in StarCraft II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14857v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, motivating their use as decision-making policies in complex environments. StarCraft II (SC2), with its massive state-action space and partial observability, is a challenging testbed. However, existing LLM-based SC2 agents primarily focus on improving the policy itself and overlook integrating a learnable, action-conditioned transition model into the decision loop. To bridge this gap, we propose StarWM, the first world model for SC2 that predicts future observations under partial observability. To facilitate learning SC2's hybrid dynamics, we introduce a structured textual representation that factorizes observations into five semantic modules, and construct SC2-Dynamics-50k, the first instruction-tuning dataset for SC2 dynamics prediction. We further develop a multi-dimensional offline evaluation framework for predicted structured observations. Offline results show StarWM's substantial gains over zero-shot baselines, including nearly 60% improvements in resource prediction accuracy and self-side macro-situation consistency. Finally, we propose StarWM-Agent, a world-model-augmented decision system that integrates StarWM into a Generate--Simulate--Refine decision loop for foresight-driven policy refinement. Online evaluation against SC2's built-in AI demonstrates consistent improvements, yielding win-rate gains of 30%, 15%, and 30% against Hard (LV5), Harder (LV6), and VeryHard (LV7), respectively, alongside improved macro-management stability and tactical risk assessment.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textbf{WebWorld} series, the first open-web simulator trained at scale. While existing simulators are restricted to closed environments with thousands of trajectories, WebWorld leverages a scalable data pipeline to train on 1M+ open-web interactions, supporting reasoning, multi-format data, and long-horizon simulations of 30+ steps. For intrinsic evaluation, we introduce WebWorld-Bench with dual metrics spanning nine dimensions, where WebWorld achieves simulation performance comparable to Gemini-3-Pro. For extrinsic evaluation, Qwen3-14B trained on WebWorld-synthesized trajectories improves by +9.2\% on WebArena, reaching performance comparable to GPT-4o. WebWorld enables effective inference-time search, outperforming GPT-5 as a world model. Beyond web simulation, WebWorld exhibits cross-domain generalization to code, GUI, and game environments, providing a replicable recipe for world model construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[WIMLE: Uncertainty-Aware World Models with IMLE for Sample-Efficient Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14351v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning promises strong sample efficiency but often underperforms in practice due to compounding model error, unimodal world models that average over multi-modal dynamics, and overconfident predictions that bias learning. We introduce WIMLE, a model-based method that extends Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) to the model-based RL framework to learn stochastic, multi-modal world models without iterative sampling and to estimate predictive uncertainty via ensembles and latent sampling. During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2). These results highlight the value of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable model-based RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026.

| **[Self-Improving World Modelling with Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06130v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARCTraj: A Dataset and Benchmark of Human Reasoning Trajectories for Abstract Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11079v3)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input-output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2026 (Datasets and Benchmarks) accepted</p></details> |
| **[WoVR: World Models as Reliable Simulators for Post-Training VLA Policies with RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13977v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to unlock capabilities beyond imitation learning for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, but its requirement for massive real-world interaction prevents direct deployment on physical robots. Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points). These results show that learned world models can serve as practical simulators for reinforcement learning when hallucination is explicitly controlled.</p></details> | 21pages, 8 figures |
| **[VLAW: Iterative Co-Improvement of Vision-Language-Action Policy and World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12063v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

| **[Debugging code world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07672v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code World Models (CWMs) are language models trained to simulate program execution by predicting explicit runtime state after every executed command. This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, under review in conference</p></details> |
| **[Compact LLM Deployment and World Model Assisted Offloading in Mobile Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13628v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates compact large language model (LLM) deployment and world-model-assisted inference offloading in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. We first propose an edge compact LLM deployment (ECLD) framework that jointly applies structured pruning, low-bit quantization, and knowledge distillation to construct edge-deployable LLM variants, and we evaluate these models using four complementary metrics: accessibility, energy consumption, hallucination rate, and generalization accuracy. Building on the resulting compact models, we formulate an MEC offloading optimization problem that minimizes the long-term average inference latency subject to per-device energy budgets and LLM-specific quality-of-service constraints on effective accuracy and hallucination. To solve this problem under unknown and time-varying network dynamics, we develop a world model-proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which augments an on-policy PPO algorithm with a learned recurrent world model that provides improved value targets and short imagination rollouts. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1-8B, Qwen3-8B, and Mistral-12B show that ECLD compresses base models by about 70-80% in storage (i.e., from 15.3 GB to 3.3 GB for Llama-3.1-8B) and reduces per-query energy consumption by up to 50%, while largely preserving accuracy and often lowering hallucination compared with quantization-only or pruning-only baselines. Moreover, they also show that world model-PPO speeds up convergence by about 50%, improves the final reward by 15.8% over vanilla PPO, and reduces average inference latency by 12-30% across different user populations, while satisfying the accuracy and hallucination constraints and approaching the generation quality of always-offloading with much of the efficiency of local execution.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is leakage-free state prediction: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Snapshot Sensing to Persistent EM World Modeling: A Generative-Space Perspective for ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13554v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromagnetic (EM) world modeling is emerging as a foundational capability for environment-aware and embodiment-enabled wireless systems. However, most existing mmWave sensing solutions are designed for snapshot-based parameter estimation and rely on hardware-intensive architectures, making scalable and persistent world modeling difficult to achieve. This article rethinks mmWave sensing from a system-level perspective and introduces a generative-space framework, in which sensing is realized through controlled traversal of a low-dimensional excitation space spanning frequency, waveform, and physical embodiment. This perspective decouples spatial observability from rigid antenna arrays and transmit-time multiplexing, enabling flexible and scalable sensing-by-design radios. To illustrate the practicality of this framework, we present a representative realization called Multi-RF Chain Frequency-as-Aperture Clip-on Aperture Fabric (MRC-FaA-CAF), where multiple FMCW sources coordinate frequency-selective modules distributed along guided-wave backbones. This architecture enables interference-free excitation, preserves beat-frequency separability, and maintains low calibration overhead. Case studies show that generative-space-driven sensing can achieve update rates comparable to phased arrays while avoiding dense RF replication and the latency penalties of TDM-MIMO systems. Overall, this work positions generative-space-driven sensing as a practical architectural foundation for mmWave systems that move beyond snapshot sensing toward persistent EM world modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures/tables</p></details> |

Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness in the presence of video prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on heterogeneous data sources over real-world robot data, synthetic simulation data, and human videos, covering over 692M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 on 12 real-world robotic tasks and a simulation benchmark. The results show that InternVLA-A1 consistently outperforms prior leading models: compared with pi0.5, it achieves +4.4\% on static manipulation tasks and +2.6\% on the RoboTwin 2.0 simulation benchmark, and delivers a +26.7\% boost on dynamic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-a1.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we quantify the amount of information an optimal policy provides about the underlying environment. We consider a Controlled Markov Process (CMP) with $n$ states and $m$ actions, assuming a uniform prior over the space of possible transition dynamics. We prove that observing a deterministic policy that is optimal for any non-constant reward function then conveys exactly $n \log m$ bits of information about the environment. Specifically, we show that the mutual information between the environment and the optimal policy is $n \log m$ bits. This bound holds across a broad class of objectives, including finite-horizon, infinite-horizon discounted, and time-averaged reward maximization. These findings provide a precise information-theoretic lower bound on the "implicit world model'' necessary for optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 0 figures.

Existing approaches often struggle with flexible view configurations, including arbitrary view combinations, numbers of views, and heterogeneous modalities. Focusing on the context of human activity recognition, we propose AliAd, a model that combines multiview contrastive learning with a mixture-of-experts module to support arbitrary view availability during both training and inference. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity from $O(V^2)$ to $O(V)$, where $V$ is the number of views. To address residual discrepancies not captured by contrastive learning, we employ a mixture-of-experts module with a specialized load balancing strategy, tasked with adapting to arbitrary view combinations. We highlight the geometric relationship among components in our model and how they combine well in the latent space. AliAd is validated on four datasets encompassing inertial and human pose modalities, with the number of views ranging from three to nine, demonstrating its performance and flexibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMPACT: Behavioral Intention-aware Multimodal Trajectory Prediction with Adaptive Context Trimming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09103v4)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior research has focused on improving the precision of multimodal trajectory predictions, the explicit modeling of multimodal behavioral intentions (e.g., yielding, overtaking) remains relatively underexplored. This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

We propose Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which assigns each retrieved memory item a dynamic reliability score by combining source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus, and uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. We also introduce MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the "Visual Placebo Effect", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench, MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.

| **[ReMoRa: Multimodal Large Language Model based on Refined Motion Representation for Long-Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16412v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, long-form video understanding remains a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

| **[Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation Framework with Hybrid Metaheuristic Optimization for Robust Early Pancreatic Neoplasm Detection in Multimodal CT Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23597v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 11th International Conference on Big Data Analytics (ICBDA)</p></details> |

We present Missing-by-Design (MBD), a unified framework for revocable multimodal sentiment analysis that combines structured representation learning with a certifiable parameter-modification pipeline. Revocability is critical in privacy-sensitive applications where users or regulators may request removal of modality-specific information. MBD learns property-aware embeddings and employs generator-based reconstruction to recover missing channels while preserving task-relevant signals. For deletion requests, the framework applies saliency-driven candidate selection and a calibrated Gaussian update to produce a machine-verifiable Modality Deletion Certificate. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that MBD achieves strong predictive performance under incomplete inputs and delivers a practical privacy-utility trade-off, positioning surgical unlearning as an efficient alternative to full retraining.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |
| **[MedVLThinker: Simple Baselines for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02669v3)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/MedVLThinker/ ; Code: https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/MedVLThinker ; Model and Data: https://huggingface.co/collections/UCSC-VLAA/medvlthinker-688f52224fb7ff7d965d581d ; Accepted by ML4H'25</p></details> |
| **[Understanding vs. Generation: Navigating Optimization Dilemma in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15772v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in multimodal models faces a key challenge where enhancing generative capabilities often comes at the expense of understanding, and vice versa. We analyzed this trade-off and identify the primary cause might be the potential conflict between generation and understanding, which creates a competitive dynamic within the model. To address this, we propose the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework. This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of "generate-understand-regenerate". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process. This offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models. Code is available at https://github.com/sen-ye/R3.</p></details> | Accepted to ICLR2026 |

While these models can often give correct answers, users also need to know where those answers come from. In this work, we study structured data attribution/citation, which is the ability of the models to point to the specific rows and columns that support an answer. We evaluate several mLLMs across different table formats and prompting strategies. Our results show a clear gap between question answering and evidence attribution. Although question answering accuracy remains moderate, attribution accuracy is much lower, near random for JSON inputs, across all models. We also find that models are more reliable at citing rows than columns, and struggle more with textual formats than images. Finally, we observe notable differences across model families. Overall, our findings show that current mLLMs are unreliable at providing fine-grained, trustworthy attribution for structured data, which limits their usage in applications requiring transparency and traceability.</p></details> |  |

In practice, users iteratively refine visualizations through multi-turn interactions that require maintaining common ground, tracking prior edits, and adapting to evolving preferences. We introduce ChartEditBench, a benchmark for incremental, visually grounded chart editing via code, comprising 5,000 difficulty-controlled modification chains and a rigorously human-verified subset. Unlike prior one-shot benchmarks, ChartEditBench evaluates sustained, context-aware editing. We further propose a robust evaluation framework that mitigates limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge metrics by integrating execution-based fidelity checks, pixel-level visual similarity, and logical code verification. Experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal substantial degradation in multi-turn settings due to error accumulation and breakdowns in shared context, with strong performance on stylistic edits but frequent execution failures on data-centric transformations. ChartEditBench, establishes a challenging testbed for grounded, intent-aware multimodal programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures including Supplementary Material</p></details> |

Building on the success of SSL4EO-S12, this extension updates the previous version to fix geospatial alignment inaccuracies and the inefficent data structure. The dataset allows low-barrier, analysis-ready data loading while maintaining the predecessor's spatial coverage of the world's 10,000 largest cities and surrounding geographies, resulting in 246k time series with nearly one million image patches. We package each time series in Zarr file format stored in WebDataset tar shards for efficient data loading and representation of meta-information such as cloud masks. We add new modalities for elevation, land-cover, and vegetation to support multimodal pre-training. Released under the CC-BY-4.0 license, SSL4EO-S12 v1.1 facilitates open research and provides a robust foundation for future advancements in self-supervised learning and geospatial analysis.

Given the paramount importance of early diagnosis, recent studies have increasingly focused on computer-aided diagnostic models to enhance precision and reliability. However, most graph-based approaches still rely on fixed structural designs, which restrict their flexibility and limit generalization across heterogeneous patient data. To overcome these limitations, the Meta-Relational Copula-Based Graph Attention Network (MRC-GAT) is proposed as an efficient multimodal model for AD classification tasks. The proposed architecture, copula-based similarity alignment, relational attention, and node fusion are integrated as the core components of episodic meta-learning, such that the multimodal features, including risk factors (RF), Cognitive test scores, and MRI attributes, are first aligned via a copula-based transformation in a common statistical space and then combined by a multi-relational attention mechanism. According to evaluations performed on the TADPOLE and NACC datasets, the MRC-GAT model achieved accuracies of 96.87% and 92.31%, respectively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing diagnostic models. Finally, the proposed model confirms the robustness and applicability of the proposed method by providing interpretability at various stages of disease diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 10 table</p></details> |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been a long-standing pillar problem in Web-scale systems and online infrastructures, such as service reliability monitoring, system fault diagnosis, and performance optimization. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in time series analysis, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, in TSAD remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. It motivates our research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? Existing studies often oversimplify the problem by treating point-wise anomalies as special cases of range-wise ones or by aggregating point anomalies to approximate range-wise scenarios. They limit our understanding for realistic scenarios such as multi-granular anomalies and irregular time series. To address the gap, we build a VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to comprehensively investigate zero-shot capabilities of MLLMs for TSAD, progressively from point-, range-, to variate-wise anomalies, and extends to irregular sampling conditions. Our study reveals several key insights in multimodal MLLMs for TSAD. Built on these findings, we propose a MLLMs-based multi-agent framework TSAD-Agents to achieve automatic TSAD. Our framework comprises scanning, planning, detection, and checking agents that synergistically collaborate to reason, plan, and self-reflect to enable automatic TSAD. These agents adaptively invoke tools such as traditional methods and MLLMs and dynamically switch between text and image modalities to optimize detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW'26)</p></details> |

However, their clinical adoption remains limited by the lack of interpretability and the tendency to hallucinate findings misaligned with imaging evidence. Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Guided Layer Fusion Mitigates Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03100v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this setting, we observe a prompt forgetting phenomenon: the semantics of the prompt representation in the text branch is progressively forgotten as depth increases. We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting. Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent gains in instruction-following capability, along with improvements on metrics capturing preference, aesthetics, and overall text--image generation quality.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[How Vision Becomes Language: A Layer-wise Information-Theoretic Analysis of Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15580v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When a multimodal Transformer answers a visual question, is the prediction driven by visual evidence, linguistic reasoning, or genuinely fused cross-modal computation -- and how does this structure evolve across layers? We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint. To establish causality, we perform targeted Image$\rightarrow$Question attention knockouts and show that disrupting the primary transduction pathway induces predictable increases in trapped visual-unique information, compensatory synergy, and total information cost -- effects that are strongest in vision-dependent tasks and weakest in high-redundancy tasks. Together, these results provide an information-theoretic, causal account of how vision becomes language in multimodal Transformers, and offer quantitative guidance for identifying architectural bottlenecks where modality-specific information is lost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Perception for Robot: Task-Aware Attention in Multimodal VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15543v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models that integrate diverse multimodal signals from multi-view inputs have emerged as an effective approach. However, most prior work adopts static fusion that processes all visual inputs uniformly, which incurs unnecessary computational overhead and allows task-irrelevant background information to act as noise. Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments.</p></details> |  |

However, most of the current literature in the field relies on small- or medium-scale datasets that are either not publicly released or built using undocumented processes. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by releasing M3L-10M and M3L-20M, two large-scale, reproducible, multimodal datasets for the movie domain, obtained by enriching with multimodal features the popular MovieLens-10M and MovieLens-20M, respectively. By following a fully documented pipeline, we collect movie plots, posters, and trailers, from which textual, visual, acoustic, and video features are extracted using several state-of-the-art encoders. We publicly release mappings to download the original raw data, the extracted features, and the complete datasets in multiple formats, fostering reproducibility and advancing the field of MRSs.

We introduce MMS-VPR, a large-scale multimodal dataset for street-level place recognition in pedestrian-only environments. MMS-VPR comprises 110,529 images and 2,527 video clips across 208 locations in a ~70,800 $m^2$ open-air commercial district in Chengdu, China. Field data were collected in 2024, while social media data span seven years (2019-2025), providing both fine-grained temporal granularity and long-term temporal coverage. Each location features comprehensive day-night coverage, multiple viewing angles, and multimodal annotations including GPS coordinates, timestamps, and semantic textual metadata. We further release MMS-VPRlib, a unified benchmarking platform that consolidates commonly used VPR datasets and state-of-the-art methods under a standardized, reproducible pipeline. MMS-VPRlib provides modular components for data pre-processing, multimodal modeling (CNN/RNN/Transformer), signal enhancement, alignment, fusion, and performance evaluation. This platform moves beyond traditional image-only paradigms, enabling systematic exploitation of complementary visual, video, and textual modalities. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yiwei-Ou/MMS-VPR and the benchmark at https://github.com/yiasun/MMS-VPRlib.</p></details> | Under review |

However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons. We conducted extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models to identify limitations in the spatial reasoning of MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in visual document understanding, the fundamental task of document packet splitting, which involves separating a document packet into individual units, remains largely unaddressed. We present the first comprehensive benchmark dataset, DocSplit, along with novel evaluation metrics for assessing the document packet splitting capabilities of large language models. DocSplit comprises five datasets of varying complexity, covering diverse document types, layouts, and multimodal settings. We formalize the DocSplit task, which requires models to identify document boundaries, classify document types, and maintain correct page ordering within a document packet. The benchmark addresses real-world challenges, including out-of-order pages, interleaved documents, and documents lacking clear demarcations. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating multimodal LLMs on our datasets, revealing significant performance gaps in current models' ability to handle complex document splitting tasks. The DocSplit benchmark datasets and proposed novel evaluation metrics provide a systematic framework for advancing document understanding capabilities essential for legal, financial, healthcare, and other document-intensive domains. We release the datasets to facilitate future research in document packet processing.</p></details> |  |

Although automated tools can enhance the identification of sexist content, they are often restricted to binary classification. Consequently, more subtle manifestations of sexism may remain undetected due to the lack of fine-grained, context-sensitive labels. To address this issue, we make the following contributions: (1) we present FineMuSe, a new multimodal sexism detection dataset in Spanish that includes both binary and fine-grained annotations; (2) we introduce a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy that encompasses forms of sexism, non-sexism, and rhetorical devices of irony and humor; and (3) we evaluate a wide range of LLMs for both binary and fine-grained sexism detection. Our findings indicate that multimodal LLMs perform competitively with human annotators in identifying nuanced forms of sexism; however, they struggle to capture co-occurring sexist types when these are conveyed through visual cues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Multimodal LLMs Perform Time Series Anomaly Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17812v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been a long-standing pillar problem in Web-scale systems and online infrastructures, such as service reliability monitoring, system fault diagnosis, and performance optimization. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in time series analysis, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly vision-language models, in TSAD remains largely under-explored. One natural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization and textual description. It motivates our research question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection? Existing studies often oversimplify the problem by treating point-wise anomalies as special cases of range-wise ones or by aggregating point anomalies to approximate range-wise scenarios. They limit our understanding for realistic scenarios such as multi-granular anomalies and irregular time series. To address the gap, we build a VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to comprehensively investigate zero-shot capabilities of MLLMs for TSAD, progressively from point-, range-, to variate-wise anomalies, and extends to irregular sampling conditions. Our study reveals several key insights in multimodal MLLMs for TSAD. Built on these findings, we propose a MLLMs-based multi-agent framework TSAD-Agents to achieve automatic TSAD. Our framework comprises scanning, planning, detection, and checking agents that synergistically collaborate to reason, plan, and self-reflect to enable automatic TSAD. These agents adaptively invoke tools such as traditional methods and MLLMs and dynamically switch between text and image modalities to optimize detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM W...</summary><p>ACM Web Conference 2026 (WWW'26)</p></details> |
| **[Text-Guided Layer Fusion Mitigates Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03100v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs for Simple Visual Planning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15460v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating reasoning in large language models and large vision-language models has recently led to significant improvement of their capabilities. However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization. Finally, purely text-based models consistently outperform those utilizing image-based inputs, including a recently proposed approach relying on latent space reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Despite its simplicity, our system delivers competitive performance with a single multimodal LLM call per fact-check at just $0.013 on average using GPT5.1 via OpenAI Batch API. Our system is also easy to reproduce and tweak, consisting of only three decoupled modules - a textual retrieval module based on similarity search, an image retrieval module based on API-accessed RIS, and a generation module using GPT5.1 - which is why we suggest it as an accesible starting point for further experimentation. We publish its code and prompts, as well as our vector stores and insights into the scheme's running costs and directions for further improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[RF-GPT: Teaching AI to See the Wireless World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14833v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models have become powerful general-purpose reasoning systems. However, radio-frequency (RF) signals, which underpin wireless systems, are still not natively supported by these models. Existing LLM-based approaches for telecom focus mainly on text and structured data, while conventional RF deep-learning models are built separately for specific signal-processing tasks, highlighting a clear gap between RF perception and high-level reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce RF-GPT, a radio-frequency language model (RFLM) that utilizes the visual encoders of multimodal LLMs to process and understand RF spectrograms. In this framework, complex in-phase/quadrature (IQ) waveforms are mapped to time-frequency spectrograms and then passed to pretrained visual encoders. The resulting representations are injected as RF tokens into a decoder-only LLM, which generates RF-grounded answers, explanations, and structured outputs. To train RF-GPT, we perform supervised instruction fine-tuning of a pretrained multimodal LLM using a fully synthetic RF corpus. Standards-compliant waveform generators produce wideband scenes for six wireless technologies, from which we derive time-frequency spectrograms, exact configuration metadata, and dense captions. A text-only LLM then converts these captions into RF-grounded instruction-answer pairs, yielding roughly 12,000 RF scenes and 0.625 million instruction examples without any manual labeling. Across benchmarks for wideband modulation classification, overlap analysis, wireless-technology recognition, WLAN user counting, and 5G NR information extraction, RF-GPT achieves strong multi-task performance, whereas general-purpose VLMs with no RF grounding largely fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[V2V-LLM: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Cooperative Autonomous Driving with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09980v4)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autonomous driving vehicles rely mainly on their individual sensors to understand surrounding scenes and plan for future trajectories, which can be unreliable when the sensors are malfunctioning or occluded. To address this problem, cooperative perception methods via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication have been proposed, but they have tended to focus on perception tasks like detection or tracking. How those approaches contribute to overall cooperative planning performance is still under-explored. Inspired by recent progress using Large Language Models (LLMs) to build autonomous driving systems, we propose a novel problem setting that integrates a Multimodal LLM into cooperative autonomous driving, with the proposed Vehicle-to-Vehicle Question-Answering (V2V-QA) dataset and benchmark. We also propose our baseline method Vehicle-to-Vehicle Multimodal Large Language Model (V2V-LLM), which uses an LLM to fuse perception information from multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and answer various types of driving-related questions: grounding, notable object identification, and planning. Experimental results show that our proposed V2V-LLM can be a promising unified model architecture for performing various tasks in cooperative autonomous driving, and outperforms other baseline methods that use different fusion approaches. Our work also creates a new research direction that can improve the safety of future autonomous driving systems. The code and data will be released to the public to facilitate open-source research in this field.

| **[DenseMLLM: Standard Multimodal LLMs are Intrinsic Dense Predictors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14134v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in high-level visual understanding. However, extending these models to fine-grained dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, typically necessitates the incorporation of complex, task-specific decoders and other customizations. This architectural fragmentation increases model complexity and deviates from the generalist design of MLLMs, ultimately limiting their practicality. In this work, we challenge this paradigm by accommodating standard MLLMs to perform dense predictions without requiring additional task-specific decoders. The proposed model is called DenseMLLM, grounded in the standard architecture with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels and tasks. Despite its minimalist design, our model achieves highly competitive performance across a wide range of dense prediction and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that a standard, general-purpose MLLM can effectively support dense perception without architectural specialization.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |

The system consists of two components: (1) a social navigation framework implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 that integrates real-time RGB-D perception using an OAK-D Lite camera, YOLOv8-based object detection, COMPOSER-based collective activity recognition, D* Lite dynamic path planning, and haptic feedback via vibration motors for tasks such as locating a vacant seat; and (2) an agentic multimodal LLM-VLM interaction framework that integrates speech recognition, vision language models, large language models, and text-to-speech, with dynamic routing between voice-only and vision-only modes to enable natural voice-based communication, scene description, and object localization from visual input. The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions. Group activity recognition further shows robust performance across diverse crowd scenarios. In addition, a preliminary exploratory user study with eight visually impaired and low-vision participants evaluates the agentic interaction framework through structured tasks and a UTAUT-based questionnaire reveals high acceptance and positive perceptions of usability, trust, and perceived sociability during our experiments. The results highlight the potential of PISHYAR as a multimodal assistive mobility aid that extends beyond navigation to provide socially interactive support for such users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal LLM With Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts for VQA on 3D Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25889v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiparametric 3D brain MRI (mpMRI) is central to neuroradiology, but producing tumor location, appearance, size, and involvement of critical structures for neurosurgical planning remains challenging. We introduce mpLLM, a multimodal LLM for visual question answering (VQA) on mpMRI that produces clinically interpretable tumor descriptors (e.g., volume, morphology, extent, and coarse localization) as an adjunct to clinical expertise for referring neurosurgeons. mpLLM uses a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) to fuse multiple 3D sequences via routing over modality- and token-level projection experts, enabling data-efficient end-to-end training without large-scale image-report pretraining. To address limited paired image-text supervision, we propose a synthetic VQA protocol that derives clinically grounded questions and answers from expert segmentation annotations and is validated with radiologist collaboration. Across multiple mpMRI datasets, mpLLM improves over strong medical VLM baselines by +5.5 points on average (+9.1% relative) and increases radiologist-rated clinical acceptability by +15.9 points (+46.6% relative). Our study features three main contributions: (1) the first VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a hierarchical MoE architecture for joint reasoning over interrelated 3D sequences, and (3) expert-supported evidence of clinical utility. Source code is available at https://github.com/arvindmvepa/mpllm, and we will release the dataset upon publication.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance. We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Reasoning Benchmark: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Classroom-Authentic Visual Problems from Primary Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12196v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI models have achieved state-of-the-art results in textual reasoning; however, their ability to reason over spatial and relational structures remains a critical bottleneck -- particularly in early-grade maths, which relies heavily on visuals. This paper introduces the visual reasoning benchmark (VRB), a novel dataset designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to solve authentic visual problems from classrooms. This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions. Consequently, education-focused benchmarks like the VRB are essential for determining the functional boundaries of multimodal tools used in classrooms.</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeNeuron: Neuron-Level Safety Alignment for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12158v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs are typically safety-aligned before release to prevent harmful content generation. However, recent studies show that safety behaviors are concentrated in a small subset of parameters, making alignment brittle and easily bypassed through neuron-level attacks. Moreover, most existing alignment methods operate at the behavioral level, offering limited control over the model's internal safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations. Extensive experiments across models and modalities demonstrate that SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities. Furthermore, our layer-wise analysis reveals that safety behaviors are governed by stable and shared internal representations. Overall, SafeNeuron provides an interpretable and robust perspective for model alignment.</p></details> |  |

To address the above challenges, this paper presents EasyUUV, a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced, universal, and lightweight simulation-to-reality reinforcement learning (RL) framework for robust attitude control of UUVs. EasyUUV combines parallelized RL training with a hybrid control architecture, where a learned policy outputs high-level attitude corrections executed by an adaptive S-Surface controller. A multimodal LLM is further integrated to adaptively tune controller parameters at runtime using visual and textual feedback, enabling training-free adaptation to unmodeled dynamics. Also, we have developed a low-cost 6-DoF UUV platform and applied an RL policy trained through efficient parallelized simulation. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and outstanding performance of EasyUUV in achieving robust and adaptive UUV attitude control across diverse underwater conditions.

Existing work tackling these dimensions through specialized datasets and single-task systems often miss opportunities for scalability, cross-task transfer, and broader generalization. To address this gap, we curate Human Behavior Atlas, a unified benchmark of diverse behavioral tasks designed to support the development of foundation models for understanding psychological and social behaviors. Human Behavior Atlas comprises over 100,000 samples spanning text, audio, and visual modalities, covering tasks on affective states, cognitive states, pathologies, and social processes. Our unification efforts can reduce redundancy and cost, enable training to scale efficiently across tasks, and enhance generalization of behavioral features across domains. On Human Behavior Atlas, we train three models: Omnisapiens-7B SFT, Omnisapiens-7B BAM, and Omnisapiens-7B RL. We show that training on Human Behavior Atlas enables models to consistently outperform existing multimodal LLMs across diverse behavioral tasks. Pretraining on Human Behavior Atlas also improves transfer to novel behavioral datasets; with the targeted use of behavioral descriptors yielding meaningful performance gains. The benchmark, models, and codes can be found at: https://github.com/MIT-MI/human_behavior_atlas.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026 Main Conference</p></details> |

Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Existing Table-as-Text approaches flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with precise semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both modalities for every query-table pair within large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly fine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing pretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight 2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path (Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair, reducing redundancy and avoiding conflicts that arise when textual and visual views of the same table provide inconsistent cues. By routing to the most appropriate view, our framework improves both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of 4.02%.

We introduce SACRED-Bench (Speech-Audio Composition for RED-teaming) to evaluate the robustness of LLMs under complex audio-based attacks. Unlike existing perturbation-based methods that rely on noise optimization or white-box access, SACRED-Bench exploits speech-audio composition to enable effective black-box attacks. SACRED-Bench adopts three composition mechanisms: (a) overlap of harmful and benign speech, (b) mixture of benign speech with harmful non-speech audio, and (c) multi-speaker dialogue. These mechanisms focus on evaluating safety in settings where benign and harmful intents co-occur within a single auditory scene. Moreover, questions in SACRED-Bench are designed to implicitly refer to content in the audio, such that no explicit harmful information appears in the text prompt alone. Experiments demonstrate that even Gemini 2.5 Pro, a state-of-the-art proprietary LLM with safety guardrails fully enabled, still exhibits a 66% attack success rate. To bridge this gap, we propose SALMONN-Guard, the first guard model that jointly inspects speech, audio, and text for safety judgments, reducing the attack success rate to 20%. Our results highlight the need for audio-aware defenses to ensure the safety of multimodal LLMs. The dataset and SALMONN-Guard checkpoints can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/SACRED-Bench.</p></details> |  |

Despite its relevance, research remains limited and text-based, leaving key questions unresolved about leveraging audio information, handling ASR errors, and transcript-free evaluation. We address these gaps through three contributions: (1) a systematic comparison between text-based models with acoustic features, a novel audio-only architecture (AudioSeg) operating on learned audio representations, and multimodal LLMs; (2) empirical analysis of factors affecting performance, including transcript quality, acoustic features, duration, and speaker composition; and (3) formalized evaluation protocols contrasting transcript-dependent text-space protocols with transcript-invariant time-space protocols. Our experiments on YTSeg reveal that AudioSeg substantially outperforms text-based approaches, pauses provide the largest acoustic gains, and MLLMs remain limited by context length and weak instruction following, yet MLLMs are promising on shorter audio.</p></details> |  |

We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective. Across diverse anomaly scenarios, AnomSeer, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct, outperforms larger commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o) in classification and localization accuracy, particularly on point- and frequency-driven exceptions. Moreover, it produces plausible time-series reasoning traces that support its conclusions.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do MLLMs Really See It: Reinforcing Visual Attention in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08241v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has substantially improved multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, existing approaches largely rely on long textual reasoning trajectories and provide limited mechanisms for learning stable visual attention policies. Our analysis shows that current MLLMs exhibit weak visual focus: early-stage visual misalignment is rarely corrected during subsequent reasoning, leading to error propagation and failed inferences. We argue that this limitation stems from inadequate credit assignment for visual attention during training. To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward. This reward explicitly aligns optimization signals with visually grounded reasoning steps, enabling the model to learn more reliable attention behaviors. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SAYO consistently improves performance on diverse reasoning and perception tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their computational cost is a major bottleneck, as they are often designed to inefficiently process the full video context regardless of the inpainting mask's size, even for sparse, localized edits. In this paper, we introduce EditCtrl, an efficient video inpainting control framework that focuses computation only where it is needed. Our approach features a novel local video context module that operates solely on masked tokens, yielding a computational cost proportional to the edit size. This local-first generation is then guided by a lightweight temporal global context embedder that ensures video-wide context consistency with minimal overhead. Not only is EditCtrl 10 times more compute efficient than state-of-the-art generative editing methods, it even improves editing quality compared to methods designed with full-attention. Finally, we showcase how EditCtrl unlocks new capabilities, including multi-region editing with text prompts and autoregressive content propagation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yehonathanlitman.github.io/edit_ctrl</p></details> |

While traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features mimicking clinical scales, recent advances in video foundation models (VFMs) enable representation learning without task-specific customization. However, the comparative effectiveness of different VFM architectures across diverse clinical tasks remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale systematic study using a novel video dataset from 1,888 participants (727 with PD), comprising 32,847 videos across 16 standardized clinical tasks. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art VFMs -- including VideoPrism, V-JEPA, ViViT, and VideoMAE -- to determine their robustness in clinical screening. By evaluating frozen embeddings with a linear classification head, we demonstrate that task saliency is highly model-dependent: VideoPrism excels in capturing visual speech kinematics (no audio) and facial expressivity, while V-JEPA proves superior for upper-limb motor tasks. Notably, TimeSformer remains highly competitive for rhythmic tasks like finger tapping. Our experiments yield AUCs of 76.4-85.3% and accuracies of 71.5-80.6%. While high specificity (up to 90.3%) suggests strong potential for ruling out healthy individuals, the lower sensitivity (43.2-57.3%) highlights the need for task-aware calibration and integration of multiple tasks and modalities. Overall, this work establishes a rigorous baseline for VFM-based PD screening and provides a roadmap for selecting suitable tasks and architectures in remote neurological monitoring.

However, they usually fail to produce satisfactory outputs that are aligned to users' authentic demands and preferences. In this work, we introduce Dual-Iterative Optimization (Dual-IPO), an iterative paradigm that sequentially optimizes both the reward model and the video generation model for improved synthesis quality and human preference alignment. For the reward model, our framework ensures reliable and robust reward signals via CoT-guided reasoning, voting-based self-consistency, and preference certainty estimation. Given this, we optimize video foundation models with guidance of signals from reward model's feedback, thus improving the synthesis quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. The reward model and video generation model complement each other and are progressively improved in the multi-round iteration, without requiring tediously manual preference annotations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Dual-IPO can effectively and consistently improve the video generation quality of base model with various architectures and sizes, even help a model with only 2B parameters surpass a 5B one. Moreover, our analysis experiments and ablation studies identify the rational of our systematic design and the efficacy of each component.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, their performance on video remains inferior to Video Foundation Models (VFMs). In this paper, we focus on leveraging MLLMs for video-text embedding and retrieval. We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce a lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related video-text embedding learning without visual supervision. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning beyond text, our method outperforms current methods, often by a substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art results across common video retrieval benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://iyttor.github.io/VidVec/</p></details> |
| **[Simulating the Visual World with Artificial Intelligence: A Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08585v4)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangling shared and modality-specific representations within multimodal foundation model embeddings can enhance clinical interpretability and generalization. To validate this hypothesis, we propose DIVINE a fully disentangled multimodal framework that operates on representations extracted from state-of-the-art (SOTA) audio and video foundation models, incorporating hierarchical variational bottlenecks, sparse gated fusion, and learnable symptom tokens. DIVINE operates in a multitask learning setup to jointly predict diagnostic categories (Healthy Control,ALS, Stroke) and severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe). The model is trained using synchronized audio and video inputs and evaluated on the Toronto NeuroFace dataset under full (audio-video) as well as single-modality (audio-only and video-only) test conditions. Our proposed approach, DIVINE achieves SOTA result, with the DeepSeek-VL2 and TRILLsson combination reaching 98.26% accuracy and 97.51% F1-score. Under modality-constrained scenarios, the framework performs well, showing strong generalization when tested with video-only or audio-only inputs. It consistently yields superior performance compared to unimodal models and baseline fusion techniques. To the best of our knowledge, DIVINE is the first framework that combines cross-modal disentanglement, adaptive fusion, and multitask learning to comprehensively assess neurological disorders using synchronized speech and facial video.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2026</p></details> |
| **[Wow, wo, val! A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04137v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGOnline: Segment Any Gaussians Online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08219v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit 3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation remains challenging. Existing segmentation approaches typically rely on high-dimensional feature lifting, which causes costly optimization, implicit semantics, and task-specific constraints. We present \textbf{Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline)}, a unified, zero-shot framework that achieves real-time, cross-view consistent segmentation without scene-specific training. SAGOnline decouples the monolithic segmentation problem into lightweight sub-tasks. By integrating video foundation models (e.g., SAM 2), we first generate temporally consistent 2D masks across rendered views. Crucially, instead of learning continuous feature fields, we introduce a \textbf{Rasterization-aware Geometric Consensus} mechanism that leverages the traceability of the Gaussian rasterization pipeline. This allows us to deterministically map 2D predictions to explicit, discrete 3D primitive labels in real-time. This discrete representation eliminates the memory and computational burden of feature distillation, enabling instant inference. Extensive evaluations on NVOS and SPIn-NeRF benchmarks demonstrate that SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (92.7\% and 95.2\% mIoU) while operating at the fastest speed at 27 ms per frame. By providing a flexible interface for diverse foundation models, our framework supports instant prompt, instance, and semantic segmentation, paving the way for interactive 3D understanding in AR/VR and robotics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10675v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</p></details> |  |

After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vidfm-3d-probe.github.io</p></details> |

Unlike previous methods that involve custom architectural designs and task-specific pretraining, our research finds that general-purpose models pretrained on videos can be readily transferred to multi-view problems with minimal adaptation. The core insight is that general-purpose attention between patches learns temporal and spatial information for geometric reasoning. We demonstrate that appending a linear decoder to the Transformer backbone produces satisfactory results, and iterative refinement can further elevate performance to stateof-the-art levels. This conceptually simple approach achieves top cross-dataset generalization results for optical flow estimation with end-point error (EPE) of 0.69, 1.78, and 3.15 on the Sintel clean, Sintel final, and KITTI datasets, respectively. Our method additionally establishes a new record on the online test benchmark with EPE values of 0.79, 1.88, and F1 value of 3.79. Applications to 3D depth estimation and stereo matching also show strong performance, illustrating the versatility of video-pretrained models in addressing geometric vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 20206, Project website: geovit-aaai26.github.io</p></details> |
| **[MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14691v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Generative Spatiotemporal Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12508v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore spatiotemporal data augmentation using video foundation models to diversify both camera viewpoints and scene dynamics. Unlike existing approaches based on simple geometric transforms or appearance perturbations, our method leverages off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate realistic 3D spatial and temporal variations from a given image dataset. Incorporating these synthesized video clips as supplemental training data yields consistent performance gains in low-data settings, such as UAV-captured imagery where annotations are scarce. Beyond empirical improvements, we provide practical guidelines for (i) choosing an appropriate spatiotemporal generative setup, (ii) transferring annotations to synthetic frames, and (iii) addressing disocclusion - regions newly revealed and unlabeled in generated views. Experiments on COCO subsets and UAV-captured datasets show that, when applied judiciously, spatiotemporal augmentation broadens the data distribution along axes underrepresented by traditional and prior generative methods, offering an effective lever for improving model performance in data-scarce regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[InternVideo-Next: Towards General Video Foundation Models without Video-Text Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01342v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing semantic HOI benchmarks focused either on manipulation or on the resulting effects at a coarse level, lacking fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning to capture the underlying dynamics in HOI. We introduce HanDyVQA, a fine-grained video question-answering benchmark that comprehensively covers both the manipulation and effect aspects of HOI. HanDyVQA comprises six complementary question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, and Object Parts), totalling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs. Collected QA pairs recognizing manipulation styles, hand/object motions, and part-level state changes. HanDyVQA also includes 10.3K segmentation masks for Objects and Object Parts questions, enabling the evaluation of object/part-level reasoning in video object segmentation. We evaluated recent video foundation models on our benchmark and found that even the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, reached only 73% average accuracy, which is far from human performance (97%). Further analysis shows the remaining challenges in spatial relationship, motion, and part-level geometric understanding. We also found that integrating explicit HOI-related cues into visual features improves performance, offering insights for developing future models with a deeper understanding of HOI dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://masatate.github.io/HanDyVQA-project-page/</p></details> |

Existing public datasets typically require manual YouTube crawling, which yields low usable volume due to link rot and access limits, and raises licensing uncertainty. This work addresses this challenge by introducing ViMix-14M, a curated multi-source video-text dataset of around 14 million pairs that provides crawl-free, download-ready access and long-form, high-quality captions tightly aligned to video. ViMix-14M is built by merging diverse open video sources, followed by unified de-duplication and quality filtering, and a multi-granularity, ground-truth-guided re-captioning pipeline that refines descriptions to better match actions, scenes, and temporal structure. We evaluate the dataset by multimodal retrieval, text-to-video generation, and video question answering tasks, observing consistent improvements over counterpart datasets. We hope this work can help removing the key barrier to training and fine-tuning open-source video foundation models, and provide insights of building high-quality and generalizable video-text datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Synthetic Video Realism Enhancement via Structure-aware Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14719v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wyf0824.github.io/Video_Realism_Enhancement/</p></details> |
| **[Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205v4)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EUSIPCO 2025 - 5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Pretrain to Pain: Adversarial Vulnerability of Video Foundation Models Without Task Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07049v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Video Foundation Models (VFMs) has significantly advanced various video-related tasks, either through task-specific models or Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the open accessibility of VFMs also introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video models.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Oral presentation)</p></details> |
| **[VMDT: Decoding the Trustworthiness of Video Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05682v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundation models become more sophisticated, ensuring their trustworthiness becomes increasingly critical; yet, unlike text and image, the video modality still lacks comprehensive trustworthiness benchmarks. We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

| **[VidEmo: Affective-Tree Reasoning for Emotion-Centric Video Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02712v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges. Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo), specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG) consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.</p></details> | 41 pages, 26 figures |
| **[FantasyWorld: Geometry-Consistent World Modeling via Unified Video and 3D Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21657v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception, outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.</p></details> |  |

Built on a flow-based architecture, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World generation in a single model and leverages [Cosmos-Reason1], a Physical AI vision-language model, to provide richer text grounding and finer control of world simulation. Trained on 200M curated video clips and refined with reinforcement learning-based post-training, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] achieves substantial improvements over [Cosmos-Predict1] in video quality and instruction alignment, with models released at 2B and 14B scales. These capabilities enable more reliable synthetic data generation, policy evaluation, and closed-loop simulation for robotics and autonomous systems. We further extend the family with [Cosmos-Transfer2.5], a control-net style framework for Sim2Real and Real2Real world translation. Despite being 3.5$\times$ smaller than [Cosmos-Transfer1], it delivers higher fidelity and robust long-horizon video generation. Together, these advances establish [Cosmos-Predict2.5] and [Cosmos-Transfer2.5] as versatile tools for scaling embodied intelligence. To accelerate research and deployment in Physical AI, we release source code, pretrained checkpoints, and curated benchmarks under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5 and https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5. We hope these open resources lower the barrier to adoption and foster innovation in building the next generation of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenLit: Reformulating Single-Image Relighting as Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11224v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the implicit scene understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows and inter-reflections. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape, and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or ray-tracing. .
