| **[Empowering Agentic Video Analytics Systems with Video Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00254v4)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly important across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%. The source code of AVA is available at https://github.com/I-ESC/Project-Ava. The AVA-100 benchmark can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/iesc/Ava-100.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NDSI 2026, 19pages, 12 figures, complementary evaluations and appendix</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Temporal Understanding in Video-LLMs through Stacked Temporal Attention in Vision Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26027v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge. Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM) architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition. We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to +5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are available at: https://alirasekh.github.io/STAVEQ2/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[StreamingCoT: A Dataset for Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Streaming VideoQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25332v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be accessed at https://github.com/Fleeting-hyh/StreamingCoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-LMM Post-Training: A Deep Dive into Video Reasoning with Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05034v5)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships, long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

| **[VideoTG-R1: Boosting Video Temporal Grounding via Curriculum Reinforcement Learning on Reflected Boundary Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23397v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples. (1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically, we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Vision-LLMs in Surveillance Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23190v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse 2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy. These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description, and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating VLMs is publicly available at: https://github.com/pascalbenschopTU/VLLM_AnomalyRecognition</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as poster in the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI</p></details> |
| **[VideoHallu: Evaluating and Mitigating Multi-modal Hallucinations on Synthetic Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01481v4)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong results in video understanding, yet a key question remains: do they truly comprehend visual content or only learn shallow correlations between vision and language? Real visual understanding, especially of physics and common sense, is essential for AI systems that interact with the physical world. Current evaluations mostly use real-world videos similar to training data, so high benchmark scores may not reflect real reasoning ability. To address this, we propose negative-control tests using videos that depict physically impossible or logically inconsistent events. We introduce VideoHallu, a synthetic dataset of physics- and commonsense-violating scenes generated with Veo2, Sora, and Kling. It includes expert-annotated question-answer pairs across four categories of violations. Tests of leading VLMs (Qwen-2.5-VL, Video-R1, VideoChat-R1) show that, despite strong results on benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU, they often miss these violations, exposing gaps in visual reasoning. Reinforcement learning fine-tuning on VideoHallu improves recognition of such violations without reducing standard benchmark performance. Our data is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[MECD+: Unlocking Event-Level Causal Graph Discovery for Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07227v4)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video causal reasoning aims to achieve a high-level understanding of videos from a causal perspective. However, it exhibits limitations in its scope, primarily executed in a question-answering paradigm and focusing on brief video segments containing isolated events and basic causal relations, lacking comprehensive and structured causality analysis for videos with multiple interconnected events. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task and dataset, Multi-Event Causal Discovery (MECD). It aims to uncover the causal relations between events distributed chronologically across long videos. Given visual segments and textual descriptions of events, MECD identifies the causal associations between these events to derive a comprehensive and structured event-level video causal graph explaining why and how the result event occurred. To address the challenges of MECD, we devise a novel framework inspired by the Granger Causality method, incorporating an efficient mask-based event prediction model to perform an Event Granger Test. It estimates causality by comparing the predicted result event when premise events are masked versus unmasked. Furthermore, we integrate causal inference techniques such as front-door adjustment and counterfactual inference to mitigate challenges in MECD like causality confounding and illusory causality. Additionally, context chain reasoning is introduced to conduct more robust and generalized reasoning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework in reasoning complete causal relations, outperforming GPT-4o and VideoChat2 by 5.77% and 2.70%, respectively. Further experiments demonstrate that causal relation graphs can also contribute to downstream video understanding tasks such as video question answering and video event prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.17647</p></details> |
| **[Video-Skill-CoT: Skill-based Chain-of-Thoughts for Domain-Adaptive Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03525v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding, emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://video-skill-cot.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[MUVR: A Multi-Modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval Benchmark with Multi-Level Visual Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21406v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos, tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance) and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3) Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base, Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and reranking.

| **[Two Causally Related Needles in a Video Haystack](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19853v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Properly evaluating the ability of Video-Language Models (VLMs) to understand long videos remains a challenge. We propose a long-context video understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities insufficiently addressed by existing benchmarks: (1) extracting information from two separate locations (two needles) in a long video and understanding them jointly, and (2) modeling the world in terms of cause and effect in human behaviors. Causal2Needles evaluates these abilities using noncausal one-needle, causal one-needle, and causal two-needle questions. The most complex question type, causal two-needle questions, require extracting information from both the cause and effect events from a long video and the associated narration text. To prevent textual bias, we introduce two complementary question formats: locating the video clip containing the answer, and verbal description of a visual detail from that video clip. Our experiments reveal that models excelling on existing benchmarks struggle with causal 2-needle questions, and the model performance is negatively correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight critical limitations in current VLMs. The dataset is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/causal2needles/Causal2Needles</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 D&B Track</p></details> |
| **[InfiniPot-V: Memory-Constrained KV Cache Compression for Streaming Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15745v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time-quickly exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii) keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four open-source MLLMs and four long-video and streaming-video benchmarks, InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation, and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy-even in multi-turn dialogues. By dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge, InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[HRT1: One-Shot Human-to-Robot Trajectory Transfer for Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21026v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel system for human-to-robot trajectory transfer that enables robots to manipulate objects by learning from human demonstration videos. The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our system</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures and 3 tables.

| **[SeViCES: Unifying Semantic-Visual Evidence Consensus for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20622v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs) can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection for Video-LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-o3 Video: Grounded Video Reasoning with Explicit Spatio-Temporal Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20579v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3 have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers, allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets, STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision. On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and improving answer reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conan: Progressive Learning to Reason Like a Detective over Multi-Scale Visual Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20470v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further. To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification, evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy combined with an Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[PreFM: Online Audio-Visual Event Parsing via Predictive Future Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23155v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual event parsing plays a crucial role in understanding multimodal video content, but existing methods typically rely on offline processing of entire videos with huge model sizes, limiting their real-time applicability. We introduce Online Audio-Visual Event Parsing (On-AVEP), a novel paradigm for parsing audio, visual, and audio-visual events by sequentially analyzing incoming video streams. The On-AVEP task necessitates models with two key capabilities: (1) Accurate online inference, to effectively distinguish events with unclear and limited context in online settings, and (2) Real-time efficiency, to balance high performance with computational constraints. To cultivate these, we propose the Predictive Future Modeling (PreFM) framework featured by (a) predictive multimodal future modeling to infer and integrate beneficial future audio-visual cues, thereby enhancing contextual understanding and (b) modality-agnostic robust representation along with focal temporal prioritization to improve precision and generalization. Extensive experiments on the UnAV-100 and LLP datasets show PreFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly fewer parameters, offering an insightful approach for real-time multimodal video understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/XiaoYu-1123/PreFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[DMC$^3$: Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction for Egocentric Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20285v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples. Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the \textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decomposed Attention Fusion in MLLMs for Training-Free Video Reasoning Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19592v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks. Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://www.jshyun.me/projects/decaf</p></details> |

While advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world domains.

Our benchmark excels in three key areas: \textbf{a) Long-Duration, Information-Dense Videos:} We carefully select approximately 1,000 videos from open-source datasets FineVideo based on duration limit and the information density of both visual and audio modalities, focusing on content like lectures, interviews, and vlogs, which contain rich language elements. \textbf{b) Diverse and Challenging Task Scenarios:} We have designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized questions and answer options. Based on LongInsightBench, we designed a series of experiments. Experimental results shows that Omni-modal models(OLMs) still face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset and code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LongInsightBench-910F/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ARR Rolling Review</p></details> |
| **[Think With Videos For Agentic Long-Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10821v5)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).</p></details> |  |
| **[StreamingTOM: Streaming Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18269v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them, keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$ lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS. These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.</p></details> |  |

However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available to foster future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://github.com/NJU-LINK/MT-Video-Bench</p></details> |

While image-language models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) show strong open-set recognition, they lack temporal modeling needed for video understanding. We propose ActAlign, a truly zero-shot, training-free method that formulates video classification as a sequence alignment problem, preserving the generalization strength of pretrained image-language models. For each class, a large language model (LLM) generates an ordered sequence of sub-actions, which we align with video frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on ActionAtlas--the most diverse benchmark of fine-grained actions across multiple sports--where human performance is only 61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using 8x fewer parameters. Our approach is model-agnostic and domain-general, demonstrating that structured language priors combined with classical alignment methods can unlock the open-set recognition potential of image-language models for fine-grained video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2025 - Project page: https://amir-aghdam.github.io/act-align/</p></details> |

Existing video-to-4D methods typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines, advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages; 21 figures; 3 tables; project page: https://see-4d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26782v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves. Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment. GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridge and Bound: A Logic-Based Framework for Abstracting (Preliminary Report)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26654v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At its core, abstraction is the process of generalizing from specific instances to broader concepts or models, with the primary objective of reducing complexity while preserving properties essential to the intended purpose. It is a fundamental, often implicit, principle that structures the understanding, communication, and development of both scientific knowledge and everyday beliefs. Studies on abstraction have evolved from its origins in Ancient Greek philosophy through methodological approaches in psychological and philosophical theories to computational frameworks. Formally, abstraction can be understood as the transformation of a source representation into an abstract representation that discards certain details while retaining desirable features. In real-world modeling and reasoning, abstraction is crucial, particularly when managing imperfect or incomplete information that calls for approximate representations. This paper introduces a novel logic-based framework for modeling abstraction processes that goes beyond the traditional entailment of necessary conditions to encompass sufficient conditions as well. We define approximate abstractions, study their tightest and exact forms, and extend the approach to layered abstractions, enabling hierarchical simplification of complex systems and models. The computational complexity of the related reasoning tasks is also discussed. For clarity, our framework is developed within classical logic, chosen for its simplicity, expressiveness, and computational friendliness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emu3.5: Native Multimodal Models are World Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26583v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA), which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction, accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance. Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://emu.world</p></details> |
| **[Co-Evolving Latent Action World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26433v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM, while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning, establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Provenance Testing for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00706v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are increasingly customized through fine-tuning and other adaptations, creating challenges in enforcing licensing terms and managing downstream impacts. Tracking model origins is crucial both for protecting intellectual property and for identifying derived models when biases or vulnerabilities are discovered in foundation models. We address this challenge by developing a framework for testing model provenance: Whether one model is derived from another. Our approach is based on the key observation that real-world model derivations preserve significant similarities in model outputs that can be detected through statistical analysis. Using only black-box access to models, we employ multiple hypothesis testing to compare model similarities against a baseline established by unrelated models. On two comprehensive real-world benchmarks spanning models from 30M to 4B parameters and comprising over 600 models, our tester achieves 90-95% precision and 80-90% recall in identifying derived models. These results demonstrate the viability of systematic provenance verification in production environments even when only API access is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning World Models for Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21996v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational world models must be both interactive and preserve spatiotemporal coherence for effective future planning with action choices. However, present models for long video generation have limited inherent world modeling capabilities due to two main challenges: compounding errors and insufficient memory mechanisms. We enhance image-to-video models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context learning capabilities of current video models. Our work illuminates the fundamental challenges in video world models and establishes a comprehensive benchmark for improving video generation models with internal world modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sites.google.com/view/vrag</p></details> |
| **[Off-policy Reinforcement Learning with Model-based Exploration Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25529v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration. The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FutureSightDrive: Thinking Visually with Spatio-Temporal CoT for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17685v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are increasingly used for end-to-end driving due to their world knowledge and reasoning ability. Most prior work, however, inserts textual chains-of-thought (CoT) as intermediate steps tailored to the current scene. Such symbolic compressions can blur spatio-temporal relations and discard fine visual cues, creating a cross-modal gap between perception and planning. We propose FSDrive, a visual spatio-temporal CoT framework that enables VLAs to think in images. The model first acts as a world model to generate a unified future frame that overlays coarse but physically-plausible priors-future lane dividers and 3D boxes-on the predicted future image. This unified frame serves as the visual CoT, capturing both spatial structure and temporal evolution. The same VLA then functions as an inverse-dynamics model, planning trajectories from current observations and the visual CoT. To equip VLAs with image generation while preserving understanding, we introduce a unified pre-training paradigm that expands the vocabulary to include visual tokens and jointly optimizes VQA (for semantics) and future-frame prediction (for dynamics). A progressive easy-to-hard scheme first predicts lane/box priors to enforce physical constraints, then completes full future frames for fine details. On nuScenes and NAVSIM, FSDrive improves trajectory accuracy and reduces collisions under both ST-P3 and UniAD metrics, and attains competitive FID for future-frame generation despite using lightweight autoregression. It also advances scene understanding on DriveLM. Together, these results indicate that visual CoT narrows the cross-modal gap and yields safer, more anticipatory planning.

| **[Vision-Centric 4D Occupancy Forecasting and Planning via Implicit Residual World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16729v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes, which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds. To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[AtlasGS: Atlanta-world Guided Surface Reconstruction with Implicit Structured Gaussians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25129v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Evolving Diagnostic Agents in a Virtual Clinical Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24654v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34% higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by 7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Mind World Models: A General Framework for Learning in Dynamic Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24546v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the popularity of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks, existing approaches that rely on model-free RL (MFRL) and model-based RL (MBRL) are data inefficient and short-sighted. Such RL-based solutions cannot generalize to novel network states since they capture only statistical patterns rather than the underlying physics and logic from wireless data. These limitations become particularly challenging in complex wireless networks with high dynamics and long-term planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel dual-mind world model-based learning framework is proposed with the goal of optimizing completeness-weighted age of information (CAoI) in a challenging mmWave V2X scenario. Inspired by cognitive psychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven System 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and logic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over reliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end differentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended horizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment interactions. Moreover, through imagination rollouts, the proposed world model can jointly reason network states and plan link scheduling. During intervals without observations, the proposed method remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a realistic simulator based on Sionna with real-world physical channel, ray-tracing, and scene objects with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency and achieves strong generalization and adaptation to unseen environments, compared to the state-of-the-art RL baselines, and the world model approach with only System 1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Dreaming: A Global Workspace Approach to World Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21142v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Affordance Representation and Recognition for Autonomous Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24459v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations prevents agents from adapting to evolving services. This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive, and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.</p></details> |  |

| **[Human Machine Social Hybrid Intelligence:A Collaborative Decision Making Framework for Large Model Agent Groups and Human Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24030v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in large foundation models and multi-agent systems offer unprecedented capabilities, yet current Human-in-the-Loop (HiTL) paradigms inadequately integrate human expertise, often leading to cognitive overload and decision-making bottlenecks in complex, high-stakes environments. We propose the "Human-Machine Social Hybrid Intelligence" (HMS-HI) framework, a novel architecture designed for deep, collaborative decision-making between groups of human experts and LLM-powered AI agents. HMS-HI is built upon three core pillars: (1) a \textbf{Shared Cognitive Space (SCS)} for unified, multi-modal situational awareness and structured world modeling; (2) a \textbf{Dynamic Role and Task Allocation (DRTA)} module that adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable agent (human or AI) based on capabilities and workload; and (3) a \textbf{Cross-Species Trust Calibration (CSTC)} protocol that fosters transparency, accountability, and mutual adaptation through explainable declarations and structured feedback. Validated in a high-fidelity urban emergency response simulation, HMS-HI significantly reduced civilian casualties by 72\% and cognitive load by 70\% compared to traditional HiTL approaches, demonstrating superior decision quality, efficiency, and human-AI trust. An ablation study confirms the critical contribution of each module, highlighting that engineered trust and shared context are foundational for scalable, synergistic human-AI collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMPASS: Cross-embodiment Mobility Policy via Residual RL and Skill Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16372v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robots are increasingly deployed in diverse application domains, enabling robust mobility across different embodiments has become a critical challenge. Classical mobility stacks, though effective on specific platforms, require extensive per-robot tuning and do not scale easily to new embodiments. Learning-based approaches, such as imitation learning (IL), offer alternatives, but face significant limitations on the need for high-quality demonstrations for each embodiment. To address these challenges, we introduce COMPASS, a unified framework that enables scalable cross-embodiment mobility using expert demonstrations from only a single embodiment. We first pre-train a mobility policy on a single robot using IL, combining a world model with a policy model. We then apply residual reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently adapt this policy to diverse embodiments through corrective refinements. Finally, we distill specialist policies into a single generalist policy conditioned on an embodiment embedding vector. This design significantly reduces the burden of collecting data while enabling robust generalization across a wide range of robot designs. Our experiments demonstrate that COMPASS scales effectively across diverse robot platforms while maintaining adaptability to various environment configurations, achieving a generalist policy with a success rate approximately 5X higher than the pre-trained IL policy on unseen embodiments, and further demonstrates zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deductive Chain-of-Thought Augmented Socially-aware Robot Navigation World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23509v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces. However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space, collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation.

| **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/junjxiao/world-env.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Active Inference with Diffusion Policy and Multiple Timescale World Model for Real-World Exploration and Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23258v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robotic navigation in real-world environments requires exploration to acquire environmental information as well as goal-directed navigation in order to reach specified targets. Active inference (AIF) based on the free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios. These results highlight how AIF based on EFE minimization can unify exploration and goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.</p></details> | Preprint version |
| **[Semantic Communications with World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24785v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication is a promising technique for emerging wireless applications, which reduces transmission overhead by transmitting only task-relevant features instead of raw data. However, existing methods struggle under extremely low bandwidth and varying channel conditions, where corrupted or missing semantics lead to severe reconstruction errors. To resolve this difficulty, we propose a world foundation model (WFM)-aided semantic video transmission framework that leverages the predictive capability of WFMs to generate future frames based on the current frame and textual guidance. This design allows transmissions to be omitted when predictions remain reliable, thereby saving bandwidth. Through WFM's prediction, the key semantics are preserved, yet minor prediction errors tend to amplify over time. To mitigate issue, a lightweight depth-based feedback module is introduced to determine whether transmission of the current frame is needed. Apart from transmitting the entire frame, a segmentation-assisted partial transmission method is proposed to repair degraded frames, which can further balance performance and bandwidth cost. Furthermore, an active transmission strategy is developed for mobile scenarios by exploiting camera trajectory information and proactively scheduling transmissions before channel quality deteriorates. Simulation results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces transmission overhead while maintaining task performances across varying scenarios and channel conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

| **[Unveiling Intrinsic Text Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models through Attention Key-Space Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative (Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key space rather than solely from external data factors.</p></details> |  |

However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emu3.5: Native Multimodal Models are World Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26583v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA), which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction, accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance. Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://emu.world</p></details> |
| **[Dependency Structure Augmented Contextual Scoping Framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11331v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) seeks to extract fine-grained information from image-text pairs to identify aspect terms and determine their sentiment polarity. However, existing approaches often fall short in simultaneously addressing three core challenges: Sentiment Cue Perception (SCP), Multimodal Information Misalignment (MIM), and Semantic Noise Elimination (SNE). To overcome these limitations, we propose DASCO (\textbf{D}ependency Structure \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{Sco}ping Framework), a fine-grained scope-oriented framework that enhances aspect-level sentiment reasoning by leveraging dependency parsing trees. First, we designed a multi-task pretraining strategy for MABSA on our base model, combining aspect-oriented enhancement, image-text matching, and aspect-level sentiment-sensitive cognition. This improved the model's perception of aspect terms and sentiment cues while achieving effective image-text alignment, addressing key challenges like SCP and MIM. Furthermore, we incorporate dependency trees as syntactic branch combining with semantic branch, guiding the model to selectively attend to critical contextual elements within a target-specific scope while effectively filtering out irrelevant noise for addressing SNE problem. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across three subtasks demonstrate that DASCO achieves state-of-the-art performance in MABSA, with notable gains in JMASA (+2.3\% F1 and +3.5\% precision on Twitter2015).

| **[Combining Unsupervised Learning and Statistical Inference For Multimodal N-of-1 Trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06455v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>N-of-1 trials are within-person crossover trials allowing both personalized and population-level inference on the effect of health interventions. Using the full potential of modern technologies, multimodal N-of-1 trials can integrate multimedia data for measuring health outcomes. However, methodology required for automated applications in large multimodal trials is not available yet. Here, we present an unsupervised approach for modeling multimodal N-of-1 trials, bypassing the need for expensive outcome labeling by medical experts. First, an autoencoder is trained on the outcome medical images. Then, the dimensionality of embeddings is reduced by extracting the first principal component, which is finally tested for its association with the treatment. Results from imaging simulation studies show high power in detecting a treatment effect while controlling type I error rates. An application to imaging N-of-1 trials of acne severity identifies individual treatment effects and supports that our methodology can enable large clinical multimodal N-of-1 trials.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 figures |

Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Oral; Project Homepage: https://yanzehong.github.io/trust-vl/</p></details> |

To address the lack of resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor, target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other), and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model (VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms, producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in multimodal humor understanding and content moderation.

| **[Contribution-Guided Asymmetric Learning for Robust Multimodal Fusion under Imbalance and Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26289v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning faces two major challenges: modality imbalance and data noise, which significantly affect the robustness and generalization ability of models. Existing methods achieve modality balance by suppressing dominant modalities, but they neglect the inherent differences in the information value between modalities, potentially leading to convergence to suboptimal solutions. This paper proposes an innovative modality compression paradigm, Contribution-Guided Asymmetric Learning (CAL), which aims to enhance the contribution of high-contribution modalities while compressing weak modalities to increase their contribution, allowing both to improve the performance of multimodal information fusion. CAL is based on a modality contribution metric W^m combining the information quantity I(m) and confidence D(m), and it designs an asymmetric gradient acceleration mechanism and a contribution-aware Asymmetric Information Bottleneck (AIB) compression mechanism. The former accelerates the gradient update of modalities, while the latter dynamically compresses the noise of low-contribution modalities. On five benchmark datasets, including emotion recognition, scene recognition, and event localization tasks, CAL has shown outstanding performance in imbalanced fusion tasks and noise robustness tests. On CREMA-D, KS, and AVE, CAL achieves 79.30%, 74.82%, and 74.21% accuracy, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art model ARL. In high-noise robustness tests, CAL also achieved leading performance under various attack strategies on the MVSA-Single and NYUD2 datasets. These results validate the significant advantages of CAL in modality imbalance and noise interference. CAL, as a flexible and efficient framework, is easy to transfer to other tasks and has broad adaptability and potential application prospects.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present Open3D-VQA, a novel benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' ability to reason about complex spatial relationships from an aerial perspective. The benchmark comprises 73k QA pairs spanning 7 general spatial reasoning tasks, including multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer formats, and supports both visual and point cloud modalities. The questions are automatically generated from spatial relations extracted from both real-world and simulated aerial scenes. Evaluation on 13 popular MLLMs reveals that: 1) Models are generally better at answering questions about relative spatial relations than absolute distances, 2) 3D LLMs fail to demonstrate significant advantages over 2D LLMs, and 3) Fine-tuning solely on the simulated dataset can significantly improve the model's spatial reasoning performance in real-world scenarios. We release our benchmark, data generation pipeline, and evaluation toolkit to support further research: https://github.com/EmbodiedCity/Open3D-VQA.code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defending Multimodal Backdoored Models by Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20392v4)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal contrastive learning models (e.g., CLIP) can learn high-quality representations from large-scale image-text datasets, while they exhibit significant vulnerabilities to backdoor attacks, raising serious safety concerns. In this paper, we reveal that CLIP's vulnerabilities primarily stem from its tendency to encode features beyond in-dataset predictive patterns, compromising its visual feature resistivity to input perturbations. This makes its encoded features highly susceptible to being reshaped by backdoor triggers. To address this challenge, we propose Repulsive Visual Prompt Tuning (RVPT), a novel defense approach that employs deep visual prompt tuning with a specially designed feature-repelling loss. Specifically, RVPT adversarially repels the encoded features from deeper layers while optimizing the standard cross-entropy loss, ensuring that only predictive features in downstream tasks are encoded, thereby enhancing CLIP's visual feature resistivity against input perturbations and mitigating its susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Unlike existing multimodal backdoor defense methods that typically require the availability of poisoned data or involve fine-tuning the entire model, RVPT leverages few-shot downstream clean samples and only tunes a small number of parameters. Empirical results demonstrate that RVPT tunes only 0.27\% of the parameters in CLIP, yet it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods, reducing the attack success rate from 89.70\% to 2.76\% against the most advanced multimodal attacks on ImageNet and effectively generalizes its defensive capabilities across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[FESTA: Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment of Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16648v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the Findings of EMNLP, 2025</p></details> |

However, current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks, and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for, compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models (LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS, which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection, cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g., GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMEdge: Accelerating On-device Multimodal Inference via Pipelined Sensing and Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25327v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding. Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units, allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/HKUST-MINSys-Lab/MMEdge.

However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2) insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships among them from multimodal unstructured data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Think Then Embed: Generative Context Improves Multimodal Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05014v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Genomics into Multimodal EHR Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23639v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an innovative Electronic Health Record (EHR) foundation model that integrates Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) as a foundational data modality, moving beyond traditional EHR-only approaches to build more holistic health profiles. Leveraging the extensive and diverse data from the All of Us (AoU) Research Program, this multimodal framework aims to learn complex relationships between clinical data and genetic predispositions. The methodology extends advancements in generative AI to the EHR foundation model space, enhancing predictive capabilities and interpretability. Evaluation on AoU data demonstrates the model's predictive value for the onset of various conditions, particularly Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and illustrates the interplay between PRS and EHR data. The work also explores transfer learning for custom classification tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility and efficiency. This approach is pivotal for unlocking new insights into disease prediction, proactive health management, risk stratification, and personalized treatment strategies, laying the groundwork for more personalized, equitable, and actionable real-world evidence generation in healthcare.</p></details> |  |

Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated information about this survey, codes and implementation of the open benchmarks can be found at https://github.com/zhengxuJosh/Awesome-Spatial-Reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Clinicians routinely encounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited examples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or considering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question answering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is largely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL benchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each including a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task demonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer triplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further introduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A comprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit moderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended evaluations, ICL contributes only an 8% average improvement over zero-shot on SMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant in-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade performance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, we observe that MLLMs are affected by a recency bias, where placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial performance improvements of up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical limitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks from context. SMMILE is available at https://smmile-benchmark.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Datasets & Benchmarks Track)</p></details> |

We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has transformed diabetes care, its potential for supporting sub-health populations -- such as individuals who are overweight, prediabetic, or anxious -- remains underexplored. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in health coaching, yet CGM is rarely incorporated as a first-class signal. To address this gap, we conducted a six-week autoethnography, combining CGM with multimodal indicators captured via common digital devices and a chatbot that offered personalized reflections and explanations of glucose fluctuations. Our findings show how CGM-led, data-first multimodal tracking, coupled with conversational support, shaped everyday practices of diet, activity, stress, and wellbeing. This work contributes to HCI by extending CGM research beyond clinical diabetes and demonstrating how LLM-driven agents can support preventive health and reflection in at-risk populations.</p></details> | <details><summary>confe...</summary><p>conference paper, prepint</p></details> |

However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be accessed at https://github.com/Fleeting-hyh/StreamingCoT.</p></details> |  |

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |

We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the Findings of EMNLP, 2025</p></details> |

However, these efforts are still far from achieving a truly universal molecular model. We identify three key challenges in this endeavor: (1) Existing molecular task datasets are typically small in scale and lack comprehensive domain coverage. (2) Tasks from different molecular subfields are difficult to effectively learn jointly through LLMs due to significant distributional shifts and competition among tasks, which introduces instability in the learning process. (3) Both inter-task and intra-task molecular representations demand different intrinsic dimensions in the language space, making it challenging to balance between redundancy and insufficiency in language model representations. To address these challenges, we innovatively categorize existing small-molecule tasks into four types: Mol2Mol, Mol2Text, Mol2Num, and Text2Mol. We then collect a dataset encompassing over 16 tasks with more than 1.4 million samples, making it the largest molecular instruction-tuning dataset to date. Leveraging the extensive pretraining of LLMs on existing chemical literature, we propose a novel multimodal LLM framework, named Omni-Mol, which unifies all small-molecule tasks and supports both molecular generation and understanding. The core of Omni-Mol is our proposed MoGE, which dynamically adapts to the intrinsic rank of different tasks. This mixture-of-experts architecture enhances the model's ability to handle diverse tasks and modalities effectively. Our model achieves unified instruction tuning across 16 tasks and attains state-of-the-art performance on 13 of them. Extensive experiments further demonstrate the scalability and versatility of Omni-Mol.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables, paper accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2) insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data. To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships among them from multimodal unstructured data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing long-context benchmarks like Needle-in-a-Haystack primarily focus on unstructured text, neglecting the challenge of diverse structured tables. Meanwhile, previous tabular benchmarks mainly consider downstream tasks that require high-level reasoning abilities, and overlook models' underlying fine-grained perception of individual table cells, which is crucial for practical and robust LLM-based table applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{NeedleInATable} (NIAT), a new long-context tabular benchmark that treats each table cell as a ``needle'' and requires models to extract the target cell based on cell locations or lookup questions. Our comprehensive evaluation of various LLMs and multimodal LLMs reveals a substantial performance gap between popular downstream tabular tasks and the simpler NIAT task, suggesting that they may rely on dataset-specific correlations or shortcuts to obtain better benchmark results but lack truly robust long-context understanding towards structured tables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using synthesized NIAT training data can effectively improve performance on both NIAT task and downstream tabular tasks, which validates the importance of NIAT capability for LLMs' genuine table understanding ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, grounding referring expressions beyond objects in 3D scenes remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Anywhere3D-Bench, a holistic 3D visual grounding benchmark consisting of 2,886 referring expression-3D bounding box pairs spanning four different grounding levels: human-activity areas, unoccupied space beyond objects, individual objects in the scene, and fine-grained object parts. We assess a range of state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding methods alongside large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on Anywhere3D-Bench. Experimental results reveal that space-level and part-level visual grounding pose the greatest challenges: space-level tasks require a more comprehensive spatial reasoning ability, for example, modeling distances and spatial relations within 3D space, while part-level tasks demand fine-grained perception of object composition. Even the best-performing models, Google Gemini-2.5-Pro and OpenAI o3, achieve just around 30% accuracy on space-level tasks and around 40% on part-level tasks, significantly lower than its performance on area-level and object-level tasks. These findings underscore a critical gap in current models' capacity to understand and reason about 3D scenes beyond object-level semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update v3 of the NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks paper (v2), including additional evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models.

| **[Emotion-Coherent Reasoning for Multimodal LLMs via Emotional Rationale Verifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23506v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[FairJudge: MLLM Judging for Social Attributes and Prompt Image Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22827v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues, lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1]; constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions; unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions. We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes. Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.</p></details> |  |
| **[LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23729v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.</p></details> |  |

To address the above challenges, this paper presents EasyUUV, a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced, universal, and lightweight simulation-to-reality reinforcement learning (RL) framework for robust attitude control of UUVs. EasyUUV combines parallelized RL training with a hybrid control architecture, where a learned policy outputs high-level attitude corrections executed by an adaptive S-Surface controller. A multimodal LLM is further integrated to adaptively tune controller parameters at runtime using visual and textual feedback, enabling training-free adaptation to unmodeled dynamics. Also, we have developed a low-cost 6-DoF UUV platform and applied an RL policy trained through efficient parallelized simulation. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and outstanding performance of EasyUUV in achieving robust and adaptive UUV attitude control across diverse underwater conditions.

| **[Beyond Seeing: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Tool-Enabled Image Perception, Transformation, and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12712v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce VisualToolBench, a visual tool-use reasoning benchmark that rigorously evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think-with-images paradigm. VisualToolBench comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, VisualToolBench offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Physics-informed Spatial Intelligence with Human Priors: An Autonomous Driving Pilot Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21160v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence (VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured, grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text, SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench, a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[L^2M^3OF: A Large Language Multimodal Model for Metal-Organic Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20976v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage. Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly. L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials discovery.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Continuous-Token Diffusion for Speaker-Referenced TTS in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12995v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified architectures in multimodal large language models (MLLM) have shown promise in handling diverse tasks within a single framework. In the text-to-speech (TTS) task, current MLLM-based approaches rely on discrete token representations, which disregard the inherently continuous nature of speech and can lead to loss of fine-grained acoustic information. In this work, we investigate the TTS within the MLLM paradigm using continuous speech representations. We design a dual-head architecture and implement two complementary training strategies for a robust model. (1) A diffusion head generating continuous speech representations is added on the MLLM, which is on frame-level and strictly autoregressive. (2) The original language model head is retained to preserve multitask capability and to control the start and end of speech synthesis. (3) Masked training is employed to address exposure bias in autoregressive decoding. (4) To stabilize optimization, we propose a two-stage scheme where the LM is frozen in the second stage, ensuring the diffusion head learns from a fixed input distribution. Evaluations on LibriSpeech(PC) test-clean show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art autoregressive performance, with a WER of 1.95%, speaker similarity of 0.54, and UTMOS of 4.00. The two-stage training yields a 46% relative WER reduction over the one-stage training baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining autoregressive modeling with continuous-token diffusion, supported by a two-stage training procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empathic Prompting: Non-Verbal Context Integration for Multimodal LLM Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20743v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance, and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbodiedBrain: Expanding Performance Boundaries of Task Planning for Embodied Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20578v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency. For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks, highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data, model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCIF: Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction-Following Benchmark from Scientific Talks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19634v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech, vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open research and progress in MLLMs development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/FBK-MT/MCIF | Evaluation and baselines available at https://github.com/hlt-mt/mcif</p></details> |

Considering the heavy cost of training MLLMs, it is efficient to reuse the existing ones and extend them to more modalities through Modality-incremental Continual Learning (MCL). The exploration of MCL is in its early stages. In this work, we dive into the causes of performance degradation in MCL. We uncover that it suffers not only from forgetting as in traditional continual learning, but also from misalignment between the modality-agnostic and modality-specific components. To this end, we propose an elegantly simple MCL paradigm called "MErge then ReAlign" (MERA) to address both forgetting and misalignment. MERA avoids introducing heavy model budgets or modifying model architectures, hence is easy to deploy and highly reusable in the MLLM community. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive performance of MERA, holding an average of 99.84\% Backward Relative Gain when extending to four modalities, achieving nearly lossless MCL performance. Our findings underscore the misalignment issue in MCL. More broadly, our work showcases how to adjust different components of MLLMs during continual learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited. Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo (Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57% in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably, DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/DaMo.git</p></details> |  |

Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However, previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding. Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports (1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2) modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5 on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.</p></details> |  |

This raises an intriguing question: can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER (long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings ("Text or Pixels?

In Phase-1, a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains) further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception, prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example, using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to 66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.</p></details> |  |

Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects, including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images (visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them, reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization, robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring.

Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs, \textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a \textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks; (2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose \emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics.

The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

| **[GenLit: Reformulating Single-Image Relighting as Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11224v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the implicit scene understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows and inter-reflections. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape, and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or ray-tracing. .

While our survey is not the first of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation, application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction. Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed.

In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work, we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation on the fly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ttom-t2v.github.io/</p></details> |

More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can World Models Benefit VLMs for World Dynamics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00855v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models, might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dyva-worldlm.github.io</p></details> |
| **[FantasyWorld: Geometry-Consistent World Modeling via Unified Video and 3D Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21657v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception, outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this, we present Uni3C, a unified 3D-enhanced framework for precise control of both camera and human motion in video generation. Uni3C includes two key contributions. First, we propose a plug-and-play control module trained with a frozen video generative backbone, PCDController, which utilizes unprojected point clouds from monocular depth to achieve accurate camera control. By leveraging the strong 3D priors of point clouds and the powerful capacities of video foundational models, PCDController shows impressive generalization, performing well regardless of whether the inference backbone is frozen or fine-tuned. This flexibility enables different modules of Uni3C to be trained in specific domains, i.e., either camera control or human motion control, reducing the dependency on jointly annotated data. Second, we propose a jointly aligned 3D world guidance for the inference phase that seamlessly integrates both scenic point clouds and SMPL-X characters to unify the control signals for camera and human motion, respectively. Extensive experiments confirm that PCDController enjoys strong robustness in driving camera motion for fine-tuned backbones of video generation. Uni3C substantially outperforms competitors in both camera controllability and human motion quality. Additionally, we collect tailored validation sets featuring challenging camera movements and human actions to validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/ewrfcas/Uni3C.

Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) advanced pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity.

| **[Autoregressive Universal Video Segmentation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19242v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation. Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS 2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster training on 16-frame sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToonComposer: Streamlining Cartoon Production with Generative Post-Keyframing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10881v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening, and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage. ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios. To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality, motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lg-li.github.io/project/tooncomposer</p></details> |
| **[SAGOnline: Segment Any Gaussians Online](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08219v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit 3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU) benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of 2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and robotic applications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[TRIBE: TRImodal Brain Encoder for whole-brain fMRI response prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22229v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices. Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain. Our code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/algonauts-2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMITE: Position Prompted SAM2 with Calibrated Memory for Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21732v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training, showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules, including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results, and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate, their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeqTex: Generate Mesh Textures in Video Sequence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04285v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors. However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper, we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain. To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[SciVid: Cross-Domain Evaluation of Video Models in Scientific Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03578v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single, pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five *Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior, and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, GitHub repo: https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid</p></details> |

However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset, \textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}. SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11 specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories (phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis, action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain generalization to unseen procedures and modalities.

Current approaches to video generation either ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage for themselves (see paper and comments for links).</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report website: mirage.app/research/seeing-voices, product website: mirage.app</p></details> |

These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic priors for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR |
| **[Large-scale Self-supervised Video Foundation Model for Intelligent Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02692v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-Assisted Intervention (CAI) has the potential to revolutionize modern surgery, with surgical scene understanding serving as a critical component in supporting decision-making, improving procedural efficacy, and ensuring intraoperative safety. While existing AI-driven approaches alleviate annotation burdens via self-supervised spatial representation learning, their lack of explicit temporal modeling during pre-training fundamentally restricts the capture of dynamic surgical contexts, resulting in incomplete spatiotemporal understanding. In this work, we introduce the first video-level surgical pre-training framework that enables joint spatiotemporal representation learning from large-scale surgical video data. To achieve this, we constructed a large-scale surgical video dataset comprising 3,650 videos and approximately 3.55 million frames, spanning more than 20 surgical procedures and over 10 anatomical structures. Building upon this dataset, we propose SurgVISTA (Surgical Video-level Spatial-Temporal Architecture), a reconstruction-based pre-training method that captures intricate spatial structures and temporal dynamics through joint spatiotemporal modeling. Additionally, SurgVISTA incorporates image-level knowledge distillation guided by a surgery-specific expert to enhance the learning of fine-grained anatomical and semantic features. To validate its effectiveness, we established a comprehensive benchmark comprising 13 video-level datasets spanning six surgical procedures across four tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgVISTA consistently outperforms both natural- and surgical-domain pre-trained models, demonstrating strong potential to advance intelligent surgical systems in clinically meaningful scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Foundation Models for Robust and Generalizable 6-DOF Bronchoscopy Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24249v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based 6-DOF bronchoscopy localization offers a promising solution for accurate and cost-effective interventional guidance. However, existing methods struggle with 1) limited generalization across patient cases due to scarce labeled data, and 2) poor robustness under visual degradation, as bronchoscopy procedures frequently involve artifacts such as occlusions and motion blur that impair visual information. To address these challenges, we propose PANSv2, a generalizable and robust bronchoscopy localization framework. Motivated by PANS that leverages multiple visual cues for pose likelihood measurement, PANSv2 integrates depth estimation, landmark detection, and centerline constraints into a unified pose optimization framework that evaluates pose probability and solves for the optimal bronchoscope pose. To further enhance generalization capabilities, we leverage the endoscopic foundation model EndoOmni for depth estimation and the video foundation model EndoMamba for landmark detection, incorporating both spatial and temporal analyses. Pretrained on diverse endoscopic datasets, these models provide stable and transferable visual representations, enabling reliable performance across varied bronchoscopy scenarios. Additionally, to improve robustness to visual degradation, we introduce an automatic re-initialization module that detects tracking failures and re-establishes pose using landmark detections once clear views are available. Experimental results on bronchoscopy dataset encompassing 10 patient cases show that PANSv2 achieves the highest tracking success rate, with an 18.1% improvement in SR-5 (percentage of absolute trajectory error under 5 mm) compared to existing methods, showing potential towards real clinical usage.</p></details> |  |

However, these datasets have primarily focused on open-air scenarios and have largely overlooked underwater animal tracking-especially the complex challenges posed by camouflaged marine animals. To bridge this gap, we take a step forward by proposing the first large-scale multi-modal underwater camouflaged object tracking dataset, namely UW-COT220. Based on the proposed dataset, this work first comprehensively evaluates current advanced visual object tracking methods, including SAM- and SAM2-based trackers, in challenging underwater environments, \eg, coral reefs. Our findings highlight the improvements of SAM2 over SAM, demonstrating its enhanced ability to handle the complexities of underwater camouflaged objects. Furthermore, we propose a novel vision-language tracking framework called VL-SAM2, based on the video foundation model SAM2. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across underwater and open-air object tracking datasets.

| **[From Image to Video, what do we need in multimodal LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11865v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covering from Image LLMs to the more complex Video LLMs, the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated profound capabilities in comprehending cross-modal information as numerous studies have illustrated. Previous methods delve into designing comprehensive Video LLMs through integrating video foundation models with primitive LLMs. Despite its effectiveness, such paradigm renders Video LLM's structure verbose and typically requires substantial video data for pre-training. Crucially, it neglects leveraging the foundational contributions of ready-made Image LLMs. In this paper, we introduce RED-VILLM, a Resource-Efficient Development pipeline which builds robust Video LLMs through leveraging the prior knowledge of Image LLMs. Specifically, since a video is naturally a combination of images along the temporal dimension, we devise a temporal adaptation plug-and-play structure, endowing the backbone Image LLM with the capability to grasp temporal information. Moreover, through applying this pipeline, we achieve the first Video LLM within the Chinese-speaking community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video LLMs developed through our approach surpass conventional Video LLMs, requiring minimal instructional data and training resources. Our approach highlights the potential for a more cost-effective and scalable advancement in multimodal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EndoMamba: An Efficient Foundation Model for Endoscopic Videos via Hierarchical Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19090v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic video-based tasks, such as visual navigation and surgical phase recognition, play a crucial role in minimally invasive surgeries by providing real-time assistance. While recent video foundation models have shown promise, their applications are hindered by (1) computational inefficiencies and (2) suboptimal performance caused by limited data for pre-training in endoscopy. To address these issues, we present EndoMamba, a foundation model designed for real-time inference while learning generalized spatiotemporal representations. First, to mitigate computational inefficiencies, we propose the EndoMamba backbone, optimized for real-time inference. Inspired by recent advancements in state space models, EndoMamba integrates Bidirectional Mamba blocks for spatial modeling within individual frames and vanilla Mamba blocks for past-to-present reasoning across the temporal domain. This design enables both strong spatiotemporal modeling and efficient inference in online video streams. Second, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical pre-training diagram to enhance EndoMamba's representation learning using endoscopic videos and incorporating general video domain knowledge. Specifically, our approach combines masked reconstruction with auxiliary supervision, leveraging low-level reconstruction to capture spatial-temporal structures and high-level alignment to transfer broader knowledge from a pretrained general-video domain foundation model. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks--classification, segmentation, surgical phase recognition, and localization--demonstrate that EndoMamba outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific methods while maintaining real-time inference speed.
