| **[UniVid: The Open-Source Unified Video Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24200v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges: maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total score compared to EasyAnimateV5.1, and 1.0% and 3.3% accuracy gains on MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA, respectively, compared with the best prior 7B baselines.

| **[HumanVideo-MME: Benchmarking MLLMs for Human-Centric Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04909v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 13 tasks, ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice, fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term (10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual lengths.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[FameMind: Frame-Interleaved Video Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24008v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies, processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in flexible and efficient video understanding.</p></details> | Underreview |
| **[V-HUB: A Visual-Centric Humor Understanding Benchmark for Video LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25773v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources, and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FrameThinker: Learning to Think with Long Videos via Multi-Turn Frame Spotlighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24304v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making policy. Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1 (72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Culturally-diverse Multilingual Multimodal Video Benchmark & Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07032v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities. ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising 1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL, that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoChat-R1: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Perception via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06958v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceive, Reflect and Understand Long Video: Progressive Multi-Granular Clue Exploration with Interactive Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24943v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding. Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME, NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.</p></details> |  |
| **[METok: Multi-Stage Event-based Token Compression for Efficient Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02850v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to understand video content. Nonetheless, processing long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1) event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and (3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025; 15 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[StreamForest: Efficient Online Video Understanding with Persistent Event Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24871v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024 tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness, efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[LOVE-R1: Advancing Long Video Understanding with an Adaptive Zoom-in Mechanism via Multi-Step Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24786v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism, which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate, inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning. As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SVAC: Scaling Is All You Need For Referring Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24109v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA) strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/lizhang1998/SVAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to BMVC 2025</p></details> |
| **[GPS-MTM: Capturing Pattern of Normalcy in GPS-Trajectories with self-supervised learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24031v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Video Panels for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23724v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long) dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Token Merging via Spatiotemporal Information Mining for Surgical Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23672v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However, current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM) method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically, the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner, STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Audio-centric Video Understanding Benchmark without Text Shortcut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19951v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio often serves as an auxiliary modality in video understanding tasks of audio-visual large language models (LLMs), merely assisting in the comprehension of visual information. However, a thorough understanding of videos significantly depends on auditory information, as audio offers critical context, emotional cues, and semantic meaning that visual data alone often lacks. This paper proposes an audio-centric video understanding benchmark (AVUT) to evaluate the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal LLMs with a particular focus on auditory information. AVUT introduces a suite of carefully designed audio-centric tasks, holistically testing the understanding of both audio content and audio-visual interactions in videos. Moreover, this work points out the text shortcut problem that largely exists in other benchmarks where the correct answer can be found from question text alone without needing videos. AVUT addresses this problem by proposing a answer permutation-based filtering mechanism. A thorough evaluation across a diverse range of open-source and proprietary multimodal LLMs is performed, followed by the analyses of deficiencies in audio-visual LLMs. Demos and data are available at https://github.com/lark-png/AVUT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Self-alignment of Large Video Language Models with Refined Regularized Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12083v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), they still struggle with fine-grained temporal understanding, hallucinate, and often make simple mistakes on even simple video question-answering tasks, all of which pose significant challenges to their safe and reliable deployment in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose a self-alignment framework that enables LVLMs to learn from their own errors. Our proposed framework first obtains a training set of preferred and non-preferred response pairs, where non-preferred responses are generated by incorporating common error patterns that often occur due to inadequate spatio-temporal understanding, spurious correlations between co-occurring concepts, and over-reliance on linguistic cues while neglecting the vision modality, among others. To facilitate self-alignment of LVLMs with the constructed preferred and non-preferred response pairs, we introduce Refined Regularized Preference Optimization (RRPO), a novel preference optimization method that utilizes sub-sequence-level refined rewards and token-wise KL regularization to address the limitations of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We demonstrate that RRPO achieves more precise alignment and more stable training compared to DPO. Our experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of our approach across diverse video tasks, including video hallucination, short- and long-video understanding, and fine-grained temporal reasoning.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Expanding Performance Boundaries of Open-Source Multimodal Models with Model, Data, and Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05271v5)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce InternVL 2.5, an advanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) series that builds upon InternVL 2.0, maintaining its core model architecture while introducing significant enhancements in training and testing strategies as well as data quality. In this work, we delve into the relationship between model scaling and performance, systematically exploring the performance trends in vision encoders, language models, dataset sizes, and test-time configurations. Through extensive evaluations on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, multi-image / video understanding, real-world comprehension, multimodal hallucination detection, visual grounding, multilingual capabilities, and pure language processing, InternVL 2.5 exhibits competitive performance, rivaling leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Notably, our model is the first open-source MLLMs to surpass 70% on the MMMU benchmark, achieving a 3.7-point improvement through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and showcasing strong potential for test-time scaling. We hope this model contributes to the open-source community by setting new standards for developing and applying multimodal AI systems.

| **[Think With Videos For Agentic Long-Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10821v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).</p></details> |  |
| **[VidBridge-R1: Bridging QA and Captioning for RL-based Video Understanding Models with Intermediate Proxy Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09079v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "Reason-Then-Respond" paradigm, enhanced by Reinforcement Learning, has shown great promise in advancing Multimodal Large Language Models. However, its application to the video domain has led to specialized models that excel at either question answering (QA) or captioning tasks, but struggle to master both. Naively combining reward signals from these tasks results in mutual performance degradation, which we attribute to a conflict between their opposing task natures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training framework built upon two intermediate proxy tasks: DarkEventInfer, which presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues; and MixVidQA, which presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. These proxy tasks compel the model to simultaneously develop both holistic, divergent understanding and precise, convergent reasoning capabilities. Embodying this framework, we present VidBridge-R1, the first versatile video reasoning model that effectively bridges the paradigm conflict. Extensive experiments show that VidBridge-R1 achieves significant performance gains on both QA and captioning within one model, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in fostering more generalizable and powerful video understanding models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-guided Representation Disentanglement for Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21783v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found in https://github.com/iamsnaping/ProDA.git</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoJudge: Bootstrapping Enables Scalable Supervision of MLLM-as-a-Judge for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21451v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks, VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation of video understanding tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[MoCLIP-Lite: Efficient Video Recognition by Fusing CLIP with Motion Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17084v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, but state-of-the-art models are often computationally expensive and rely on extensive video pre-training. In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues.

However, employing LLMs for long video understanding presents significant challenges. The extensive number of video tokens leads to considerable computational costs for LLMs while using aggregated tokens results in loss of vision details. Moreover, the presence of abundant question-irrelevant tokens introduces noise to the video reasoning process. To address these issues, we introduce a simple yet effective learnable retrieval-based video-language model (R-VLM) for efficient long video understanding. Specifically, given a question (query) and a long video, our model identifies and selects the most relevant K video chunks and uses their associated visual tokens to serve as context for the LLM inference. This effectively reduces the number of video tokens, eliminates noise interference, and enhances system performance. We achieve this by incorporating a learnable lightweight MLP block to facilitate the efficient retrieval of question-relevant chunks, through the end-to-end training of our video-language model with a proposed soft matching loss. Our experimental results on multiple zero-shot video question answering datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework for comprehending long videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |

To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.</p></details> | 16 pages |

We propose a framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a stochastic cause-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming a range of baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages.

Benchmark signatures probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora, where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure, becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap. Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected LLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Calibrated Prediction of Safety Chances for Image-Controlled Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09346v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical challenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and distribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited in scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while model-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction in end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition model nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of world models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to forecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the probability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic and composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to quantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from high-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator can deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding prediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to miscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised domain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution shift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides theoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across long prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that our UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower false positive rates under distribution shift. Similarly, world model-based composite predictors outperform their monolithic counterparts on long-horizon tasks, and our conformal calibration provides reliable statistical bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2308.12252</p></details> |
| **[MLA: A Multisensory Language-Action Model for Multimodal Understanding and Forecasting in Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26642v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs) and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

| **[Kinodynamic Motion Planning for Mobile Robot Navigation across Inconsistent World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26339v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios, consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively, defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered, GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average planning time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025 Workshop on Resilient Off-road Autonomous Robotics (ROAR)</p></details> |

While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact, motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied planning.

We propose a world-model-based policy evaluation environment (WorldGym), an autoregressive, action-conditioned video generation model which serves as a proxy to real world environments. Policies are evaluated via Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model, with a vision-language model providing rewards. We evaluate a set of VLA-based real-robot policies in the world model using only initial frames from real robots, and show that policy success rates within the world model highly correlate with real-world success rates. Moreoever, we show that WorldGym is able to preserve relative policy rankings across different policy versions, sizes, and training checkpoints. Due to requiring only a single start frame as input, the world model further enables efficient evaluation of robot policies' generalization ability on novel tasks and environments. We find that modern VLA-based robot policies still struggle to distinguish object shapes and can become distracted by adversarial facades of objects. While generating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging, WorldGym faithfully emulates robot motions and offers a practical starting point for safe and reproducible policy evaluation before deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-model-eval.github.io</p></details> |

We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models, maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global scale, while learning from local trial-and-error in exploration through a Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism which infers advantage-based progress signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration, we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2 exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention - MICCAI 2025, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 15968</p></details> |
| **[From Perception to Cognition: A Survey of Vision-Language Interactive Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25373v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound, human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information (Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent. Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent, credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework: ``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers: Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition, the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms. Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear, structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing work suffers from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second, we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU, with substantially reduced error accumulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kunhao-liu.github.io/Rolling_Forcing_Webpage/</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing embodied world models is not merely increasing the fidelity or size of environments, but scaling their structural complexity through explicit hierarchical scaffolding. We posit that an effective world model for decision-making must model not only the world's physics but also its task semantics. Drawing from a systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We propose that such structured environments are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. We further extend this principle, proposing that this scaffolding can be generalized to other complex domains and dynamically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which act as generative world models of tasks. By building environments with explicit, composable task layers, we can guide agent exploration more efficiently, generate meaningful learning signals, and ultimately train more capable and general-purpose agents with fewer resources than purely end-to-end approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Embodied World Models for Decision Making (EWM)</p></details> |
| **[World-Env: Leveraging World Model as a Virtual Environment for VLA Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24948v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings.</p></details> |  |

A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

| **[DyMoDreamer: World Modeling with Dynamic Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24804v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model (RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\% performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark.

At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI.

However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines (embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.</p></details> |  |

However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels.

| **[EvoAgent: Self-evolving Agent with Continual World Model for Long-Horizon Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05907v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Completing Long-Horizon (LH) tasks in open-ended worlds is an important yet difficult problem for embodied agents. Existing approaches suffer from two key challenges: (1) they heavily rely on experiences obtained from human-created data or curricula, failing to autonomously update and select multimodal experiences, and (2) they may encounter catastrophic forgetting issues when faced with new tasks, failing to autonomously update world knowledge. To solve these challenges, this paper presents {\it EvoAgent}, a self-evolving agent with a continual World Model (WM), which can autonomously complete various LH tasks across environments through self-planning, self-control, and self-reflection, without human intervention. Our proposed EvoAgent contains three modules, i.e., i) the memory-driven planner which uses an LLM along with the WM and interaction memory, to convert LH tasks into executable sub-tasks; ii) the WM-guided action controller which leverages WM to generate low-level actions and incorporates a self-verification mechanism to update multimodal experiences; iii) the experience-inspired reflector which implements a two-stage curriculum learning algorithm to select experiences for task-adaptive WM updates. Moreover, we develop a continual World Model for EvoAgent, which can autonomously update the multimodal experience pool and world knowledge through closed-loop dynamics. We conducted extensive experiments on Minecraft and Atair, compared with existing methods, EvoAgent can achieve an average success rate improvement of 105% and reduce ineffective actions by more than 6x.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |

In complex urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints.

We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation. Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second, action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, accepted to CoRL 2025 LSRW workshop</p></details> |

Instead, world models are emerging as an alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale, foundation world models for generally capable agents.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32 corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7 base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from 20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design, ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that supports future extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,15 figures, Accepted to the 5th Wordplay: When Language Meets Games Workshop, EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

| **[Explaining multimodal LLMs via intra-modal token interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22415v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality, attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC), which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v6)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YvanYin/GoalFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Misalignment Attacks against Multimodal Perception in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09095v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Balancing Multimodal Training Through Game-Theoretic Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07335v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning holds promise for richer information extraction by capturing dependencies across data sources. Yet, current training methods often underperform due to modality competition, a phenomenon where modalities contend for training resources leaving some underoptimized. This raises a pivotal question: how can we address training imbalances, ensure adequate optimization across all modalities, and achieve consistent performance improvements as we transition from unimodal to multimodal data? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), inspired by a mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) A game-theoretic framework that adaptively balances modality contributions by encouraging each to maximize its informative role in the final prediction 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of both task- relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Proposing latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and simple baseline, clearly demonstrating that training modalities jointly leads to important performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets. We release our code and models at https://github.com/kkontras/MCR.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Training Vision-Language Process Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling in Multimodal Reasoning: Key Insights and Lessons Learned](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23250v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.</p></details> |  |

In response, we present ViLBias, a VQA-style benchmark and framework for detecting and reasoning about bias in multimodal news. The dataset comprises 40,945 text--image pairs from diverse outlets, each annotated with a bias label and concise rationale using a two-stage LLM-as-annotator pipeline with hierarchical majority voting and human-in-the-loop validation. We evaluate Small Language Models (SLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Vision--Language Models (VLMs) across closed-ended classification and open-ended reasoning (oVQA), and compare parameter-efficient tuning strategies. Results show that incorporating images alongside text improves detection accuracy by 3--5\%, and that LLMs/VLMs better capture subtle framing and text--image inconsistencies than SLMs. Parameter-efficient methods (LoRA/QLoRA/Adapters) recover 97--99\% of full fine-tuning performance with $<5\%$ trainable parameters. For oVQA, reasoning accuracy spans 52--79\% and faithfulness 68--89\%, both improved by instruction tuning; closed accuracy correlates strongly with reasoning ($r = 0.91$). ViLBias offers a scalable benchmark and strong baselines for multimodal bias detection and rationale quality.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[SafeEraser: Enhancing Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models through Multimodal Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12520v5)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop, their potential security issues have become increasingly prominent. Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Multimodal Hallucinations via Gradient-based Self-Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual inputs. This issue can be attributed to two main biases: text-visual bias, the overreliance on prompts and prior outputs, and co-occurrence bias, spurious correlations between frequently paired objects. We propose Gradient-based Influence-Aware Constrained Decoding (GACD), an inference-based method, that addresses both biases without auxiliary models, and is readily applicable to existing models without finetuning. The core of our approach is bias estimation, which uses first-order Taylor gradients to understand the contribution of individual tokens-visual features and text tokens-to the current output. Based on this analysis, GACD mitigates hallucinations through two components: (1) suppressing spurious visual features correlated with the output objects, and (2) rebalancing cross-modal contributions by strengthening visual features relative to text. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GACD effectively reduces hallucinations and improves the visual grounding of MLLM outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[v1: Learning to Point Visual Tokens for Multimodal Grounded Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18842v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When thinking with images, humans rarely rely on a single glance: they revisit visual information repeatedly during reasoning. However, existing models typically process images only once and thereafter generate reasoning entirely in text, lacking mechanisms to re-access or ground inference in visual representations. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. Crucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines, establishing point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning. The model checkpoint and dataset are available at github.com/jun297/v1.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension -- whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e., spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest). By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://deeptracereward.github.io/</p></details> |

Our study features three main contributions: (1) the first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code, and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on caption similarity. We train a vision encoder (CLIP) using our hard negative training method, namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM, significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o. We further conduct ablation studies to analyze three key factors: hard negative types, the efficiency of image-based negatives, and training configurations. These analyses yield important insights into optimizing the training pipeline of vision encoder for fine-grained geometric reasoning tasks. https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM.</p></details> |  |

While continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL, a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID scenarios with new model abilities. Methodologically, we propose preventing catastrophic interference through parameter isolation and an MLLM-based routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

| **[MLA: A Multisensory Language-Action Model for Multimodal Understanding and Forecasting in Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26642v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs) and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images, 3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex, contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved generalization to unseen configurations.

| **[Query-Kontext: An Unified Multimodal Model for Image Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26641v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM) with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism. Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods in several cases.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |
| **[AccidentBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning in Vehicle Accidents and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26636v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation, orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000 videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard). Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning. AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/AccidentBench</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing Through Deception: Uncovering Misleading Creator Intent in Multimodal News with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15489v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impact of misinformation arises not only from factual inaccuracies but also from the misleading narratives that creators deliberately embed. Interpreting such creator intent is therefore essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) and effective information governance. To this end, we introduce DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark of 12,000 image-caption pairs grounded in trustworthy reference articles, created using an intent-guided simulation framework that models both the desired influence and the execution plan of news creators. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading cases, spanning manipulations across visual and textual modalities, and supports three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) and find that they struggle with intent reasoning, often relying on shallow cues such as surface-level alignment, stylistic polish, or heuristic authenticity signals. These results highlight the limitations of current VLMs and position DeceptionDecoded as a foundation for developing intent-aware models that go beyond shallow cues in MMD.</p></details> |  |
| **[STaR-Attack: A Spatio-Temporal and Narrative Reasoning Attack Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26473v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically, our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability. STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates, forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety alignments in UMMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MR$^2$-Bench: Going Beyond Matching to Reasoning in Multimodal Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26378v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial, and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks, current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example, the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and evaluation code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMG: Calibrating Diffusion Models via Implicit Multimodal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26231v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt, IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c) formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter, seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Human-MME: A Holistic Evaluation Benchmark for Human-Centric Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26165v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability. Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage. 2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945 real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image understanding.

| **[Fork-Merge Decoding: Enhancing Multimodal Understanding in Audio-Visual Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20873v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this work is to enhance balanced multimodal understanding in audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) by addressing modality bias without additional training. In current AV-LLMs, audio and video features are typically processed jointly in the decoder. While this strategy facilitates unified multimodal understanding, it may introduce modality bias, where the model tends to over-rely on one modality due to imbalanced training signals. To mitigate this, we propose Fork-Merge Decoding (FMD), a simple yet effective inference-time strategy that requires no additional training or architectural modifications. FMD first performs modality-specific reasoning by processing audio-only and video-only inputs through the early decoder layers (fork), and then merges the resulting hidden states for joint reasoning in the remaining layers (merge). This separation allows each modality to be emphasized in the early stages while encouraging balanced contributions during integration. We validate our method on three representative AV-LLMs-VideoLLaMA2, video-SALMONN, and Qwen2.5-Omni-using three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show consistent gains in audio, video, and audio-visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of inference-time interventions for robust and efficient multimodal understanding.</p></details> |  |

These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by conference EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[LFTR: Learning-Free Token Reduction for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17391v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in various multimodal tasks, yet their deployment is frequently limited by substantial computational demands and prolonged inference times. Given that the vision modality typically contains more comprehensive information than the text modality, resulting in encoded representations comprising an extensive number of tokens, leading to significant computational overhead due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism. Current token reduction methods are typically restricted to specific model architectures and often necessitate extensive retraining or fine-tuning, restricting their applicability to many state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we introduce a learning-free token reduction (LFTR) method designed for MLLMs. LFTR can be seamlessly integrated into most open-source MLLM architectures without requiring additional fine-tuning. By capitalizing on the redundancy in visual representations, our approach effectively reduces tokens while preserving the general inference performance of MLLMs. We conduct experiments on multiple MLLM architectures (LLaVA, MiniGPT, QwenVL), and our results show that LFTR achieves up to a $16\times$ reduction of visual tokens while maintaining or even enhancing performance on mainstream vision question-answering benchmarks, all in a learning-free setting. Additionally, LFTR is complementary to other acceleration techniques, such as vision encoder compression and post-training quantization, further promoting the efficient deployment of MLLMs. Our project is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LFTR-AAAI-0528.</p></details> |  |

| **[Grounding Multimodal LLMs to Embodied Agents that Ask for Help with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00907v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied agents operating in household environments must interpret ambiguous and under-specified human instructions. A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining multimodal LLMs via intra-modal token interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22415v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality, attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch, we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC), which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Human-Perceived Fakeness in AI-Generated Videos via Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22646v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons? While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension -- whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e., spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest). By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://deeptracereward.github.io/</p></details> |

To address limited image-text paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering (VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation. mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology. Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts and prompt-conditioned routing.</p></details> | 23 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Learning to See Before Seeing: Demystifying LLM Visual Priors from Language Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26625v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone, surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively. This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://junlinhan.github.io/projects/lsbs/</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners, achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.</p></details> |  |
| **[SETR: A Two-Stage Semantic-Enhanced Framework for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26012v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1) union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues, carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR, Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25178v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucination in Multimodal LLMs with Layer Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25177v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations. To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .</p></details> |  |
| **[ArtifactsBench: Bridging the Visual-Interactive Gap in LLM Code Generation Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04952v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cell2Text: Multimodal LLM for Generating Single-Cell Descriptions from RNA-Seq Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24840v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity, tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation. These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of unseen cells.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Function Layer in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24791v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition, narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers (VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities. Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset. This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (preview; camera-ready in preparation)</p></details> |

However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference-Based Long-Horizon Robotic Stacking with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24163v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained large language models (LLMs) can work as high-level robotic planners by reasoning over abstract task descriptions and natural language instructions, etc. However, they have shown a lack of knowledge and effectiveness in planning long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks where the physical properties of the objects are essential. An example is the stacking of containers with hidden objects inside, which involves reasoning over hidden physics properties such as weight and stability. To this end, this paper proposes to use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners for such long-horizon robotic stacking tasks. The LLM takes multimodal inputs for each object to stack and infers the current best stacking sequence by reasoning over stacking preferences. Furthermore, in order to enable the LLM to reason over multiple preferences at the same time without giving explicit instructions, we propose to create a custom dataset considering stacking preferences including weight, stability, size, and footprint, to fine-tune the LLM. Compared to the pretrained LLM with prompt tuning, we demonstrate the improved stacking completion of the LLM fine-tuned with our custom dataset via large-scale simulation evaluation. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework for the long-horizon stacking task on a real humanoid robot in an online manner.</p></details> |  |

Even state of the art MLLMs such as GPT-4o can make mistakes in distinguishing compositions like "dog chasing cat" vs "cat chasing dog". While on Winoground, a benchmark for measuring such reasoning, MLLMs have made significant progress, they are still far from a human's performance. We show that compositional reasoning in these models can be improved by elucidating such concepts via data, where a model is trained to prefer the correct caption for an image over a close but incorrect one. We introduce SCRAMBLe: Synthetic Compositional Reasoning Augmentation of MLLMs with Binary preference Learning, an approach for preference tuning open-weight MLLMs on synthetic preference data generated in a fully automated manner from existing image-caption data. SCRAMBLe holistically improves these MLLMs' compositional reasoning capabilities which we can see through significant improvements across multiple vision language compositionality benchmarks, as well as smaller but significant improvements on general question answering tasks. As a sneak peek, SCRAMBLe tuned Molmo-7B model improves on Winoground from 49.5% to 54.8% (best reported to date), while improving by ~1% on more general visual question answering tasks. Code for SCRAMBLe along with tuned models and our synthetic training dataset is available at https://github.com/samarth4149/SCRAMBLe.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Findings |

Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show potential in EO understanding but remain restricted to single-sensor inputs, overlooking the complementarity across heterogeneous modalities. We propose EarthMind, a unified vision-language framework that handles both single- and cross-sensor inputs via an innovative hierarchical cross-modal attention (ie, HCA) design. Specifically, HCA hierarchically captures visual relationships across sensors and aligns them with language queries, enabling adaptive fusion of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) features. To support cross-sensor learning, we curate FusionEO, a 30K-pair dataset with diverse annotations, and establish EarthMind-Bench, a 2,841-pair benchmark with expert annotations for perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that EarthMind achieves state-of-the-art results on EarthMind-Bench and surpasses existing MLLMs on multiple EO benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23729v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Audio-centric Video Understanding Benchmark without Text Shortcut](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19951v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio often serves as an auxiliary modality in video understanding tasks of audio-visual large language models (LLMs), merely assisting in the comprehension of visual information. However, a thorough understanding of videos significantly depends on auditory information, as audio offers critical context, emotional cues, and semantic meaning that visual data alone often lacks. This paper proposes an audio-centric video understanding benchmark (AVUT) to evaluate the video comprehension capabilities of multimodal LLMs with a particular focus on auditory information. AVUT introduces a suite of carefully designed audio-centric tasks, holistically testing the understanding of both audio content and audio-visual interactions in videos. Moreover, this work points out the text shortcut problem that largely exists in other benchmarks where the correct answer can be found from question text alone without needing videos. AVUT addresses this problem by proposing a answer permutation-based filtering mechanism. A thorough evaluation across a diverse range of open-source and proprietary multimodal LLMs is performed, followed by the analyses of deficiencies in audio-visual LLMs. Demos and data are available at https://github.com/lark-png/AVUT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

To achieve this, we first developed a quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features, several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks.

| **[EmoPrefer: Can Large Language Models Understand Human Emotion Preferences?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04278v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Descriptive Multimodal Emotion Recognition (DMER) has garnered increasing research attention. Unlike traditional discriminative paradigms that rely on predefined emotion taxonomies, DMER aims to describe human emotional state using free-form natural language, enabling finer-grained and more interpretable emotion representations. However, this free-form prediction paradigm introduces new challenges regarding its evaluation. Previous works depend on ground-truth descriptions, but emotions are inherently tied to diverse human behaviors, and generating a comprehensive and accurate description is inherently demanding. Other researchers reformulate this problem into a more tractable human preference learning task, but pairwise preference annotation involves substantial manual effort. This leads to a question: can we leverage multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to achieve more cost-efficient preference annotation? To answer this, we propose EmoPrefer, a pioneering work exploring the potential of LLMs in decoding human emotion preferences. Specifically, we construct the first emotion preference dataset, EmoPrefer-Data, featuring high-quality preference annotations from experts. Additionally, we introduce EmoPrefer-Bench, which evaluates the performance of various MLLMs and prompting techniques in preference prediction, while also revealing new strategies to enhance their performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploring the capabilities of LLMs in understanding human emotion preferences. Our work advances the field of DMER and lays the foundation for more intelligent human-computer interaction.</p></details> |  |

We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \& \textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text, audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering, significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce SpectrumLab, a pioneering unified platform designed to systematize and accelerate deep learning research in spectroscopy. SpectrumLab integrates three core components: a comprehensive Python library featuring essential data processing and evaluation tools, along with leaderboards; an innovative SpectrumAnnotator module that generates high-quality benchmarks from limited seed data; and SpectrumBench, a multi-layered benchmark suite covering 14 spectroscopic tasks and over 10 spectrum types, featuring spectra curated from over 1.2 million distinct chemical substances. Thorough empirical studies on SpectrumBench with 18 cutting-edge multimodal LLMs reveal critical limitations of current approaches. We hope SpectrumLab will serve as a crucial foundation for future advancements in deep learning-driven spectroscopy.</p></details> |  |

Despite their utility, they may fail to meet the demands of iterative workflows due to their static nature, limited engagement, and inability to adapt to evolving design needs. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) pave the way for more engaging and adaptive approaches to user representation. This paper introduces Interactive Virtual Personas (IVPs): multimodal, LLM-driven, conversational user simulations that designers can interview, brainstorm with, and gather feedback from in real time via voice interface. We conducted a qualitative study with eight professional UX designers, employing an IVP named "Alice" across three design activities: user research, ideation, and prototype evaluation. Our findings demonstrate the potential of IVPs to expedite information gathering, inspire design solutions, and provide rapid user-like feedback. However, designers raised concerns about biases, over-optimism, the challenge of ensuring authenticity without real stakeholder input, and the inability of the IVP to fully replicate the nuances of human interaction. Our participants emphasised that IVPs should be viewed as a complement to, not a replacement for, real user engagement. We discuss strategies for prompt engineering, human-in-the-loop integration, and ethical considerations for effective and responsible IVP use in design. Finally, our work contributes to the growing body of research on generative AI in the design process by providing insights into UX designers' experiences of LLM-powered interactive personas.</p></details> | <details><summary>The v...</summary><p>The version accepted for publication at International Journal of Human-Computer Studies</p></details> |

Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks, VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation of video understanding tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

Despite the established strong imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception, outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this, we present Uni3C, a unified 3D-enhanced framework for precise control of both camera and human motion in video generation. Uni3C includes two key contributions. First, we propose a plug-and-play control module trained with a frozen video generative backbone, PCDController, which utilizes unprojected point clouds from monocular depth to achieve accurate camera control. By leveraging the strong 3D priors of point clouds and the powerful capacities of video foundational models, PCDController shows impressive generalization, performing well regardless of whether the inference backbone is frozen or fine-tuned. This flexibility enables different modules of Uni3C to be trained in specific domains, i.e., either camera control or human motion control, reducing the dependency on jointly annotated data. Second, we propose a jointly aligned 3D world guidance for the inference phase that seamlessly integrates both scenic point clouds and SMPL-X characters to unify the control signals for camera and human motion, respectively. Extensive experiments confirm that PCDController enjoys strong robustness in driving camera motion for fine-tuned backbones of video generation. Uni3C substantially outperforms competitors in both camera controllability and human motion quality. Additionally, we collect tailored validation sets featuring challenging camera movements and human actions to validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/ewrfcas/Uni3C.

| **[Simplifying Traffic Anomaly Detection with Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09338v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods for ego-centric Traffic Anomaly Detection (TAD) often rely on complex multi-stage or multi-representation fusion architectures, yet it remains unclear whether such complexity is necessary. Recent findings in visual perception suggest that foundation models, enabled by advanced pre-training, allow simple yet flexible architectures to outperform specialized designs. Therefore, in this work, we investigate an architecturally simple encoder-only approach using plain Video Vision Transformers (Video ViTs) and study how pre-training enables strong TAD performance. We find that: (i) advanced pre-training enables simple encoder-only models to match or even surpass the performance of specialized state-of-the-art TAD methods, while also being significantly more efficient; (ii) although weakly- and fully-supervised pre-training are advantageous on standard benchmarks, we find them less effective for TAD. Instead, self-supervised Masked Video Modeling (MVM) provides the strongest signal; and (iii) Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT) on unlabeled driving videos further improves downstream performance, without requiring anomalous examples. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-training and show that effective, efficient, and scalable TAD models can be built with minimal architectural complexity. We release our code, domain-adapted encoders, and fine-tuned models to support future work: https://github.com/tue-mps/simple-tad.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCVW...</summary><p>ICCVW 2025 accepted.

| **[Autoregressive Universal Video Segmentation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19242v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation. Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS 2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster training on 16-frame sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToonComposer: Streamlining Cartoon Production with Generative Post-Keyframing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10881v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening, and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage. ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios. To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality, motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lg-li.github.io/project/tooncomposer</p></details> |

Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU) benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of 2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and robotic applications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[TRIBE: TRImodal Brain Encoder for whole-brain fMRI response prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22229v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices. Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

| **[SAMITE: Position Prompted SAM2 with Calibrated Memory for Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21732v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training, showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules, including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results, and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate, their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeqTex: Generate Mesh Textures in Video Sequence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04285v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors. However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper, we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain. To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing.

While promising, these models are often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single, pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five *Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior, and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, GitHub repo: https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid</p></details> |
| **[TriVLA: A Triple-System-Based Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for General Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01424v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models, enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the physical world understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image, and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and, shape and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or complex ray tracing.

However, progress in developing surgical video foundation models (FMs) remains hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse datasets for pretraining and systematic evaluation. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{SurgBench}, a unified surgical video benchmarking framework comprising a pretraining dataset, \textbf{SurgBench-P}, and an evaluation benchmark, \textbf{SurgBench-E}. SurgBench offers extensive coverage of diverse surgical scenarios, with SurgBench-P encompassing 53 million frames across 22 surgical procedures and 11 specialties, and SurgBench-E providing robust evaluation across six categories (phase classification, camera motion, tool recognition, disease diagnosis, action classification, and organ detection) spanning 72 fine-grained tasks. Extensive experiments reveal that existing video FMs struggle to generalize across varied surgical video analysis tasks, whereas pretraining on SurgBench-P yields substantial performance improvements and superior cross-domain generalization to unseen procedures and modalities.

Current approaches to video generation either ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage for themselves (see paper and comments for links).</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report website: mirage.app/research/seeing-voices, product website: mirage.app</p></details> |

These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic priors for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR |
| **[Large-scale Self-supervised Video Foundation Model for Intelligent Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02692v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-Assisted Intervention (CAI) has the potential to revolutionize modern surgery, with surgical scene understanding serving as a critical component in supporting decision-making, improving procedural efficacy, and ensuring intraoperative safety. While existing AI-driven approaches alleviate annotation burdens via self-supervised spatial representation learning, their lack of explicit temporal modeling during pre-training fundamentally restricts the capture of dynamic surgical contexts, resulting in incomplete spatiotemporal understanding. In this work, we introduce the first video-level surgical pre-training framework that enables joint spatiotemporal representation learning from large-scale surgical video data. To achieve this, we constructed a large-scale surgical video dataset comprising 3,650 videos and approximately 3.55 million frames, spanning more than 20 surgical procedures and over 10 anatomical structures. Building upon this dataset, we propose SurgVISTA (Surgical Video-level Spatial-Temporal Architecture), a reconstruction-based pre-training method that captures intricate spatial structures and temporal dynamics through joint spatiotemporal modeling. Additionally, SurgVISTA incorporates image-level knowledge distillation guided by a surgery-specific expert to enhance the learning of fine-grained anatomical and semantic features. To validate its effectiveness, we established a comprehensive benchmark comprising 13 video-level datasets spanning six surgical procedures across four tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgVISTA consistently outperforms both natural- and surgical-domain pre-trained models, demonstrating strong potential to advance intelligent surgical systems in clinically meaningful scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Foundation Models for Robust and Generalizable 6-DOF Bronchoscopy Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24249v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based 6-DOF bronchoscopy localization offers a promising solution for accurate and cost-effective interventional guidance. However, existing methods struggle with 1) limited generalization across patient cases due to scarce labeled data, and 2) poor robustness under visual degradation, as bronchoscopy procedures frequently involve artifacts such as occlusions and motion blur that impair visual information. To address these challenges, we propose PANSv2, a generalizable and robust bronchoscopy localization framework. Motivated by PANS that leverages multiple visual cues for pose likelihood measurement, PANSv2 integrates depth estimation, landmark detection, and centerline constraints into a unified pose optimization framework that evaluates pose probability and solves for the optimal bronchoscope pose. To further enhance generalization capabilities, we leverage the endoscopic foundation model EndoOmni for depth estimation and the video foundation model EndoMamba for landmark detection, incorporating both spatial and temporal analyses. Pretrained on diverse endoscopic datasets, these models provide stable and transferable visual representations, enabling reliable performance across varied bronchoscopy scenarios. Additionally, to improve robustness to visual degradation, we introduce an automatic re-initialization module that detects tracking failures and re-establishes pose using landmark detections once clear views are available. Experimental results on bronchoscopy dataset encompassing 10 patient cases show that PANSv2 achieves the highest tracking success rate, with an 18.1% improvement in SR-5 (percentage of absolute trajectory error under 5 mm) compared to existing methods, showing potential towards real clinical usage.</p></details> |  |

However, these datasets have primarily focused on open-air scenarios and have largely overlooked underwater animal tracking-especially the complex challenges posed by camouflaged marine animals. To bridge this gap, we take a step forward by proposing the first large-scale multi-modal underwater camouflaged object tracking dataset, namely UW-COT220. Based on the proposed dataset, this work first comprehensively evaluates current advanced visual object tracking methods, including SAM- and SAM2-based trackers, in challenging underwater environments, \eg, coral reefs. Our findings highlight the improvements of SAM2 over SAM, demonstrating its enhanced ability to handle the complexities of underwater camouflaged objects. Furthermore, we propose a novel vision-language tracking framework called VL-SAM2, based on the video foundation model SAM2. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed VL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across underwater and open-air object tracking datasets.

| **[From Image to Video, what do we need in multimodal LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11865v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Covering from Image LLMs to the more complex Video LLMs, the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated profound capabilities in comprehending cross-modal information as numerous studies have illustrated. Previous methods delve into designing comprehensive Video LLMs through integrating video foundation models with primitive LLMs. Despite its effectiveness, such paradigm renders Video LLM's structure verbose and typically requires substantial video data for pre-training. Crucially, it neglects leveraging the foundational contributions of ready-made Image LLMs. In this paper, we introduce RED-VILLM, a Resource-Efficient Development pipeline which builds robust Video LLMs through leveraging the prior knowledge of Image LLMs. Specifically, since a video is naturally a combination of images along the temporal dimension, we devise a temporal adaptation plug-and-play structure, endowing the backbone Image LLM with the capability to grasp temporal information. Moreover, through applying this pipeline, we achieve the first Video LLM within the Chinese-speaking community. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video LLMs developed through our approach surpass conventional Video LLMs, requiring minimal instructional data and training resources. Our approach highlights the potential for a more cost-effective and scalable advancement in multimodal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EndoMamba: An Efficient Foundation Model for Endoscopic Videos via Hierarchical Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19090v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic video-based tasks, such as visual navigation and surgical phase recognition, play a crucial role in minimally invasive surgeries by providing real-time assistance. While recent video foundation models have shown promise, their applications are hindered by (1) computational inefficiencies and (2) suboptimal performance caused by limited data for pre-training in endoscopy. To address these issues, we present EndoMamba, a foundation model designed for real-time inference while learning generalized spatiotemporal representations. First, to mitigate computational inefficiencies, we propose the EndoMamba backbone, optimized for real-time inference. Inspired by recent advancements in state space models, EndoMamba integrates Bidirectional Mamba blocks for spatial modeling within individual frames and vanilla Mamba blocks for past-to-present reasoning across the temporal domain. This design enables both strong spatiotemporal modeling and efficient inference in online video streams. Second, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical pre-training diagram to enhance EndoMamba's representation learning using endoscopic videos and incorporating general video domain knowledge. Specifically, our approach combines masked reconstruction with auxiliary supervision, leveraging low-level reconstruction to capture spatial-temporal structures and high-level alignment to transfer broader knowledge from a pretrained general-video domain foundation model. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks--classification, segmentation, surgical phase recognition, and localization--demonstrate that EndoMamba outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific methods while maintaining real-time inference speed.

VCOS involves detecting objects that blend seamlessly in the surroundings for videos, due to similar colors and textures, poor light conditions, etc. Compared to the objects in normal scenes, camouflaged objects are much more difficult to detect. SAM2, a video foundation model, has shown potential in various tasks. But its effectiveness in dynamic camouflaged scenarios remains under-explored. This study presents a comprehensive study on SAM2's ability in VCOS. First, we assess SAM2's performance on camouflaged video datasets using different models and prompts (click, box, and mask). Second, we explore the integration of SAM2 with existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and VCOS methods. Third, we specifically adapt SAM2 by fine-tuning it on the video camouflaged dataset. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SAM2 has excellent zero-shot ability of detecting camouflaged objects in videos. We also show that this ability could be further improved by specifically adjusting SAM2's parameters for VCOS.

Previous vision encoders, typically pre-trained with single-image reconstruction or two-image contrastive learning, tend to capture static information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. Recently, video diffusion models (VDMs) demonstrate the ability to predict future frames and showcase a strong understanding of physical world. We hypothesize that VDMs inherently produce visual representations that encompass both current static information and predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for robot action learning. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the Video Prediction Policy (VPP), which learns implicit inverse dynamics model conditioned on predicted future representations inside VDMs. To predict more precise future, we fine-tune pre-trained video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation data. In experiments, VPP achieves a 18.6\% relative improvement on the Calvin ABC-D generalization benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art, and demonstrates a 31.6\% increase in success rates for complex real-world dexterous manipulation tasks.

To tackle these issues, prior work has largely focused on injecting pose and appearance guidance via elaborate bypass networks, but often struggles to generalize to open-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new perspective that, as long as the foundation model is powerful enough, straightforward model modifications with flexible fine-tuning strategies can largely address the above challenges, taking a step towards controllable character animation in the wild. Specifically, we introduce RealisDance-DiT, built upon the Wan-2.1 video foundation model. Our sufficient analysis reveals that the widely adopted Reference Net design is suboptimal for large-scale DiT models. Instead, we demonstrate that minimal modifications to the foundation model architecture yield a surprisingly strong baseline. We further propose the low-noise warmup and "large batches and small iterations" strategies to accelerate model convergence during fine-tuning while maximally preserving the priors of the foundation model. In addition, we introduce a new test dataset that captures diverse real-world challenges, complementing existing benchmarks such as TikTok dataset and UBC fashion video dataset, to comprehensively evaluate the proposed method. Extensive experiments show that RealisDance-DiT outperforms existing methods by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://thefoxofsky.github.io/project_pages_new/RealisDance-DiT/index</p></details> |

Built upon the mainstream diffusion transformer paradigm, Wan achieves significant advancements in generative capabilities through a series of innovations, including our novel VAE, scalable pre-training strategies, large-scale data curation, and automated evaluation metrics. These contributions collectively enhance the model's performance and versatility. Specifically, Wan is characterized by four key features: Leading Performance: The 14B model of Wan, trained on a vast dataset comprising billions of images and videos, demonstrates the scaling laws of video generation with respect to both data and model size.

However, existing works are primarily limited to single-subject oriented text-to-video generation, leaving the more challenging problem of customized multi-subject generation unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a novel VideoDreamer framework, which can generate temporally consistent text-guided videos that faithfully preserve the visual features of the given multiple subjects. Specifically, VideoDreamer adopts the pretrained Stable Diffusion with temporal modules as its base video generator, taking the power of the text-to-image model to generate diversified content. The video generator is further customized for multi-subjects, which leverages the proposed Disen-Mix Finetuning and Human-in-the-Loop Re-finetuning strategy, to tackle the attribute binding problem of multi-subject generation. Additionally, we present a disentangled motion customization strategy to finetune the temporal modules so that we can generate videos with both customized subjects and motions. To evaluate the performance of customized multi-subject text-to-video generation, we introduce the MultiStudioBench benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable ability of VideoDreamer to generate videos with new content such as new events and backgrounds, tailored to the customized multiple subjects.</p></details> |  |
