| **[Learning Context: A Unified Framework and Roadmap for Context-Aware AI in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24362v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a unified Learning Context (LC) framework designed to transition AI-based education from context-blind mimicry to a principled, holistic understanding of the learner. This white paper provides a multidisciplinary roadmap for making teaching and learning systems context-aware by encoding cognitive, affective, and sociocultural factors over the short, medium, and long term. To realize this vision, we outline concrete steps to operationalize LC theory into an interoperable computational data structure. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP), we will enable a wide range of AI tools to "warm-start" with durable context and achieve continual, long-term personalization. Finally, we detail our particular LC implementation strategy through the OpenStax digital learning platform ecosystem and SafeInsights R&D infrastructure. Using OpenStax's national reach, we are embedding the LC into authentic educational settings to support millions of learners. All research and pedagogical interventions are conducted within SafeInsights' privacy-preserving data enclaves, ensuring a privacy-first implementation that maintains high ethical standards while reducing equity gaps nationwide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetrical Flow Matching: Unified Image Generation, Segmentation, and Classification with Score-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10634v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps. Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[A Unified View of Attention and Residual Sinks: Outlier-Driven Rescaling is Essential for Transformer Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22966v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the functional role of emergent outliers in large language models, specifically attention sinks (a few tokens that consistently receive large attention logits) and residual sinks (a few fixed dimensions with persistently large activations across most tokens). We hypothesize that these outliers, in conjunction with the corresponding normalizations (\textit{e.g.}, softmax attention and RMSNorm), effectively rescale other non-outlier components. We term this phenomenon \textit{outlier-driven rescaling} and validate this hypothesis across different model architectures and training token counts. This view unifies the origin and mitigation of both sink types. Our main conclusions and observations include: (1) Outliers function jointly with normalization: removing normalization eliminates the corresponding outliers but degrades training stability and performance; directly clipping outliers while retaining normalization leads to degradation, indicating that outlier-driven rescaling contributes to training stability. (2) Outliers serve more as rescale factors rather than contributors, as the final contributions of attention and residual sinks are significantly smaller than those of non-outliers. (3) Outliers can be absorbed into learnable parameters or mitigated via explicit gated rescaling, leading to improved training performance (average gain of 2 points) and enhanced quantization robustness (1.2 points degradation under W4A4 quantization).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Evaluation Framework for Multi-Annotator Tendency Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10393v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations. To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation framework.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[DiffuSpeech: Silent Thought, Spoken Answer via Unified Speech-Text Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22889v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current speech language models generate responses directly without explicit reasoning, leading to errors that cannot be corrected once audio is produced. We introduce \textbf{``Silent Thought, Spoken Answer''} -- a paradigm where speech LLMs generate internal text reasoning alongside spoken responses, with thinking traces informing speech quality. To realize this, we present \method{}, the first diffusion-based speech-text language model supporting both understanding and generation, unifying discrete text and tokenized speech under a single masked diffusion framework. Unlike autoregressive approaches, \method{} jointly generates reasoning traces and speech tokens through iterative denoising, with modality-specific masking schedules. We also construct \dataset{}, the first speech QA dataset with paired text reasoning traces, containing 26K samples totaling 319 hours. Experiments show \method{} achieves state-of-the-art speech-to-speech QA accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by up to 9 points, while attaining the best TTS quality among generative models (6.2\% WER) and preserving language understanding (66.2\% MMLU). Ablations confirm that both the diffusion architecture and thinking traces contribute to these gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartMeterFM: Unifying Smart Meter Data Generative Tasks Using Flow Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21706v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart meter data is the foundation for planning and operating the distribution network. Unfortunately, such data are not always available due to privacy regulations. Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Trackly: A Unified SaaS Platform for User Behavior Analytics and Real Time Rule Based Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22800v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding user behavior is essential for improving digital experiences, optimizing business conversions, and mitigating threats like account takeovers, fraud, and bot attacks. Most platforms separate product analytics and security, creating fragmented visibility and delayed threat detection. Trackly, a scalable SaaS platform, unifies comprehensive user behavior analytics with real time, rule based anomaly detection. It tracks sessions, IP based geo location, device browser fingerprints, and granular events such as page views, add to cart, and checkouts. Suspicious activities logins from new devices or locations, impossible travel (Haversine formula), rapid bot like actions, VPN proxy usage, or multiple accounts per IP are flagged via configurable rules with weighted risk scoring, enabling transparent, explainable decisions. A real time dashboard provides global session maps, DAU MAU, bounce rates, and session durations. Integration is simplified with a lightweight JavaScript SDK and secure REST APIs. Implemented on a multi tenant microservices stack (ASP.NET Core, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Next.js), Trackly achieved 98.1% accuracy, 97.7% precision, and 2.25% false positives on synthetic datasets, proving its efficiency for SMEs and ecommerce.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOTS: A Unified Framework for Bayesian Online Task Selection in LLM Reinforcement Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26374v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training. Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We introduce BOTS, a unified framework for Bayesian Online Task Selection in LLM reinforcement finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates explicit evidence from direct evaluations of selected tasks and implicit evidence inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks, with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and exploitation for task selection. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead. Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT. Code is available at https://github.com/agentscope-ai/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/bots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Herb.jl: A Unifying Program Synthesis Library](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09726v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis -- the automatic generation of code given a specification -- is one of the most fundamental tasks in artificial intelligence (AI) and the dream of many programmers. Numerous synthesizers have been developed for program synthesis, offering different approaches to the exponentially growing program space. Although such state-of-the-art tools exist, reusing and adapting them remains tedious and time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library written in Julia, to address these issues. Since current methods share similar building blocks, we aim to break down the underlying algorithms into extendable, reusable subcomponents. To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it with just a few lines of code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation Enhances Understanding in Unified Multimodal Models via Multi-Representation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21406v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Blocks: Continuous Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling for Unified LLM Quantization and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22716v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current quantization methods for LLMs predominantly rely on block-wise structures to maintain efficiency, often at the cost of representational flexibility. In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By "breaking the blocks" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Study of LoRA Variants: Taxonomy, Review, Codebase, and Empirical Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22708v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a fundamental parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that balances efficiency and performance in large-scale neural networks. However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters. Our results uncover several findings, notably: LoRA and its variants exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the choices of learning rate compared to other hyperparameters; moreover, with proper hyperparameter configurations, LoRA consistently matches or surpasses the performance of most of its variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Under Review</p></details> |
| **[VisionTrim: Unified Vision Token Compression for Training-Free MLLM Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22674v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer from high computational costs due to excessive visual tokens, particularly in high-resolution and video-based scenarios. Existing token reduction methods typically focus on isolated pipeline components and often neglect textual alignment, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VisionTrim, a unified framework for training-free MLLM acceleration, integrating two effective plug-and-play modules: 1) the Dominant Vision Token Selection (DVTS) module, which preserves essential visual tokens via a global-local view, and 2) the Text-Guided Vision Complement (TGVC) module, which facilitates context-aware token merging guided by textual cues. Extensive experiments across diverse image and video multimodal benchmarks demonstrate the performance superiority of our VisionTrim, advancing practical MLLM deployment in real-world applications.

| **[OneTrans: Unified Feature Interaction and Sequence Modeling with One Transformer in Industrial Recommender](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26104v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recommendation systems, scaling up feature-interaction modules (e.g., Wukong, RankMixer) or user-behavior sequence modules (e.g., LONGER) has achieved notable success. However, these efforts typically proceed on separate tracks, which not only hinders bidirectional information exchange but also prevents unified optimization and scaling. In this paper, we propose OneTrans, a unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior sequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer to convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token sequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar sequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential tokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables precomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly reducing computational costs during both training and inference. Experimental results on industrial-scale datasets demonstrate that OneTrans scales efficiently with increasing parameters, consistently outperforms strong baselines, and yields a 5.68% lift in per-user GMV in online A/B tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[NAG: A Unified Native Architecture for Encoder-free Text-Graph Modeling in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22657v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing methods for integrating graphs into Language Models (LMs) typically rely on a segregated architecture: external Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encode structural topology, while LMs process textual semantics. We argue this approach is suboptimal for text-graphs: it creates a conceptually disjointed interaction paradigm. By segregating structural encoding from semantic processing, these systems must perform a complex implicit alignment between abstract graph tokens and concrete textual elements. Challenging the necessity of external encoders, we propose NAG (Native Architecture for Graphs), a unified framework that internalizes graph processing within the LM's native manifold. Instead of bridging disparate embedding spaces, NAG repurposes the self-attention mechanism to enforce topological dependencies and recalibrates positional IDs to ensure structural equivalence. This allows the model to harness its intrinsic linguistic capability to simultaneously comprehend node and edge content alongside structural topology. We introduce two efficient implementations: NAG-Zero for absolute preservation of the base model's linguistic capabilities, and NAG-LoRA for enhanced structural adaptation. Experiments across diverse graph tasks validate that NAG achieves robust graph comprehension without the overhead of external encoders, offering a simpler, more coherent paradigm for text-graph modeling.</p></details> |  |

Consisting of understanding model, texture module, and geometry module, Omni-View jointly models scene understanding, novel view synthesis, and geometry estimation, enabling synergistic interaction between 3D scene understanding and generation tasks. By design, it leverages the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of its texture module responsible for appearance synthesis, alongside the explicit geometric constraints provided by its dedicated geometry module, thereby enriching the model's holistic understanding of 3D scenes. Trained with a two-stage strategy, Omni-View achieves a state-of-the-art score of 55.4 on the VSI-Bench benchmark, outperforming existing specialized 3D understanding models, while simultaneously delivering strong performance in both novel view synthesis and 3D scene generation.

| **[UniGeo: A Unified 3D Indoor Object Detection Framework Integrating Geometry-Aware Learning and Dynamic Channel Gating](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22616v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of robotics and augmented reality in real-world applications has driven considerable research interest in 3D object detection based on point clouds. While previous methods address unified training across multiple datasets, they fail to model geometric relationships in sparse point cloud scenes and ignore the feature distribution in significant areas, which ultimately restricts their performance. To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement. Then, to further enhance point cloud feature representation, we propose a dynamic channel gating mechanism that leverages learnable channel-wise weighting. This mechanism adaptively optimizes features generated by the sparse 3D U-Net network, significantly enhancing key geometric information. Extensive experiments on six different indoor scene datasets clearly validate the superior performance of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[EUGens: Efficient, Unified, and General Dense Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22563v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2025.

| **[One Ring to Rule Them All: Unifying Group-Based RL via Dynamic Power-Mean Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22521v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group-based reinforcement learning has evolved from the arithmetic mean of GRPO to the geometric mean of GMPO. While GMPO improves stability by constraining a conservative objective, it shares a fundamental limitation with GRPO: reliance on a fixed aggregation geometry that ignores the evolving and heterogeneous nature of each trajectory. In this work, we unify these approaches under Power-Mean Policy Optimization (PMPO), a generalized framework that parameterizes the aggregation geometry via the power-mean geometry exponent p. Within this framework, GRPO and GMPO are recovered as special cases. Theoretically, we demonstrate that adjusting p modulates the concentration of gradient updates, effectively reweighting tokens based on their advantage contribution. To determine p adaptively, we introduce a Clip-aware Effective Sample Size (ESS) mechanism. Specifically, we propose a deterministic rule that maps a trajectory clipping fraction to a target ESS. Then, we solve for the specific p to align the trajectory induced ESS with this target one. This allows PMPO to dynamically transition between the aggressive arithmetic mean for reliable trajectories and the conservative geometric mean for unstable ones. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PMPO outperforms strong baselines.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |
| **[RulePlanner: All-in-One Reinforcement Learner for Unifying Design Rules in 3D Floorplanning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22476v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Floorplanning determines the coordinate and shape of each module in Integrated Circuits. With the scaling of technology nodes, in floorplanning stage especially 3D scenarios with multiple stacked layers, it has become increasingly challenging to adhere to complex hardware design rules. Current methods are only capable of handling specific and limited design rules, while violations of other rules require manual and meticulous adjustment. This leads to labor-intensive and time-consuming post-processing for expert engineers. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one deep reinforcement learning-based approach to tackle these challenges, and design novel representations for real-world IC design rules that have not been addressed by previous approaches. Specifically, the processing of various hardware design rules is unified into a single framework with three key components: 1) novel matrix representations to model the design rules, 2) constraints on the action space to filter out invalid actions that cause rule violations, and 3) quantitative analysis of constraint satisfaction as reward signals. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our approach. Furthermore, transferability is well demonstrated on unseen circuits. Our framework is extensible to accommodate new design rules, thus providing flexibility to address emerging challenges in future chip design.

| **[Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizer: A Unified Framework for Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22284v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs), a family of optimization algorithms that unifies classic optimizers within one geometric framework. Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold. This perspective yields a constructive ``optimizer generator" that not only recovers classic algorithms but enables the principled design of RLOs. We validate our theory via geometric diagnostics and demonstrate that grounding optimizer design in control theory yields state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks. Overall, RLOs bridge control theory and modern machine learning optimization, providing a unified language and a systematic toolkit for designing stable, effective optimizers.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Structured Over Scale: Learning Spatial Reasoning from Educational Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23251v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on standard video understanding benchmarks yet fail systematically on simple reasoning tasks that preschool children can solve, including counting, spatial reasoning, and compositional understanding. We hypothesize that the pedagogically-structured content of educational videos provides an ideal training signal for improving these capabilities. We introduce DoraVQA, a dataset of 5,344 question-answer pairs automatically extracted from 8 seasons of Dora the Explorer with precise timestamp alignment. Each episode follows a consistent \textit{context-question-pause-answer} structure that creates a self-contained learning environment analogous to interactive tutoring. We fine-tune both Qwen2 and Qwen3 using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), leveraging the clear correctness signals and structured reasoning traces inherent in educational content. Despite training exclusively on 38 hours of children's educational videos, our approach achieves improvements of 8-14 points on DoraVQA and state-of-the-art 86.16\% on CVBench, with strong transfer to Video-MME and NExT-QA, demonstrating effective generalization from narrow pedagogical content to broad multimodal understanding. Through cross-domain benchmarks, we show that VLMs can perform tasks that require robust reasoning learned from structured educational content, suggesting that content structure matters as much as content scale.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Video-o3, a novel framework that supports iterative discovery of salient visual clues, fine-grained inspection of key segments, and adaptive termination once sufficient evidence is acquired. Technically, we address two core challenges in interleaved tool invocation. First, to mitigate attention dispersion induced by the heterogeneity of reasoning and tool-calling, we propose Task-Decoupled Attention Masking, which isolates per-step concentration while preserving shared global context. Second, to control context length growth in multi-turn interactions, we introduce a Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward that balances exploration coverage with reasoning efficiency. To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes. These results demonstrate Video-o3's strong multi-hop evidence-seeking and reasoning capabilities, and validate the effectiveness of native tool invocation in long-video scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 15 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose FaVChat, the first VLLM designed for reasoning over subtle visual and dynamic facial cues. FaVChat introduces a hierarchical, prompt guided visual feature extraction framework that emphasizes question relevant information at three complementary levels. These multi level features are dynamically fused and injected into the LLM, enabling more accurate facial details reasoning To further improve learning efficiency under data scarcity, we propose Data Efficient GRPO, a reinforcement learning strategy that iteratively identifies high utility samples and maximizes the contribution of each instance via per instance utility estimation, substantially enhancing performance gains under limited supervision. We construct a large scale benchmark dataset FaVChat 170K, comprising approximately 60K high quality facial videos and 170K question answer pairs focusing on fine grained facial details. Extensive experiments, including zero shot evaluations on four facial understanding tasks, demonstrate that FaVChat consistently outperforms existing VLLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we adapt Native Sparse Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1) reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4) the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

Existing frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, fail to adapt to variations in content density or task complexity. To address this, we present FrameOracle, a lightweight, plug-and-play module that predicts both (1) which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are needed. FrameOracle is trained via a curriculum that progresses from weak proxy signals, such as cross-modal similarity, to stronger supervision with FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA dataset with validated keyframe annotations specifying minimal sufficient frames per question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks show that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4 frames without accuracy loss. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it reduces inputs to 13.9 frames on average while improving accuracy by 1.5%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable video understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating what can be achieved when action anticipation is constrained to a single visual observation. We ask a fundamental question: how much information about the future is already encoded in a single frame, and how can it be effectively exploited? Building on our prior work on Action Anticipation at a Glimpse (AAG), we conduct a systematic investigation of single-frame action anticipation enriched with complementary sources of information. We analyze the contribution of RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, and semantic representations of past actions, and investigate how different multimodal fusion strategies, keyframe selection policies and past-action history sources influence anticipation performance. Guided by these findings, we consolidate the most effective design choices into AAG+, a refined single-frame anticipation framework. Despite operating on a single frame, AAG+ consistently improves upon the original AAG and achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, that of state-of-the-art video-based methods on challenging anticipation benchmarks including IKEA-ASM, Meccano and Assembly101. Our results offer new insights into the limits and potential of single-frame action anticipation, and clarify when dense temporal modeling is necessary and when a carefully selected glimpse is sufficient.</p></details> |  |

However, most prior work focuses on static image understanding, while their ability to process sequential audio-video data remains underexplored. This gap highlights the need for a high-quality benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLM performance in a real-world setting. We introduce SONIC-O1, a comprehensive, fully human-verified benchmark spanning 13 real-world conversational domains with 4,958 annotations and demographic metadata. SONIC-O1 evaluates MLLMs on key tasks, including open-ended summarization, multiple-choice question (MCQ) answering, and temporal localization with supporting rationales (reasoning). Experiments on closed- and open-source models reveal limitations. While the performance gap in MCQ accuracy between two model families is relatively small, we observe a substantial 22.6% performance difference in temporal localization between the best performing closed-source and open-source models. Performance further degrades across demographic groups, indicating persistent disparities in model behavior. Overall, SONIC-O1 provides an open evaluation suite for temporally grounded and socially robust multimodal understanding. We release SONIC-O1 for reproducibility and research: Project page: https://vectorinstitute.github.io/sonic-o1/ Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/vector-institute/sonic-o1 Github: https://github.com/vectorinstitute/sonic-o1 Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/vector-institute/sonic-o1-leaderboard</p></details> |  |
| **[VidLaDA: Bidirectional Diffusion Large Language Models for Efficient Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17868v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) typically encode frames via a vision encoder and employ an autoregressive (AR) LLM for understanding and generation. However, this AR paradigm inevitably faces a dual efficiency bottleneck: strictly unidirectional attention compromises understanding efficiency by hindering global spatiotemporal aggregation, while serial decoding restricts generation efficiency. To address this, we propose VidLaDA, a Video LLM based on Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) that leverages bidirectional attention to unlock comprehensive spatiotemporal modeling and decode tokens in parallel. To further mitigate the computational overhead of diffusion decoding, we introduce MARS-Cache, an acceleration strategy that prunes redundancy by combining asynchronous visual cache refreshing with frame-wise chunk attention. Experiments show VidLaDA rivals state-of-the-art AR baselines (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA-Video) and outperforms DLM baselines, with MARS-Cache delivering over 12x speedup without compromising accuracy. Code and checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/ziHoHe/VidLaDA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spava: Accelerating Long-Video Understanding via Sequence-Parallelism-aware Approximate Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21444v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency of long-video inference remains a critical bottleneck, mainly due to the dense computation in the prefill stage of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Existing methods either compress visual embeddings or apply sparse attention on a single GPU, yielding limited acceleration or degraded performance and restricting LMMs from handling longer, more complex videos. To overcome these issues, we propose Spava, a sequence-parallel framework with optimized attention that accelerates long-video inference across multiple GPUs. By distributing approximate attention, Spava reduces computation and increases parallelism, enabling efficient processing of more visual embeddings without compression and thereby improving task performance. System-level optimizations, such as load balancing and fused forward passes, further unleash the potential of Spava, delivering speedups of 12.72x, 1.70x, and 1.18x over FlashAttn, ZigZagRing, and APB, without notable performance loss.

In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

To lay the foundation for this assistant, we conducted a comprehensive data collection study where six participants lived together for one week, continuously recording their daily activities - including discussions, shopping, cooking, socializing, and entertainment - using AI glasses for multimodal egocentric video capture, along with synchronized third-person-view video references. This effort resulted in the EgoLife Dataset, a comprehensive 300-hour egocentric, interpersonal, multiview, and multimodal daily life dataset with intensive annotation. Leveraging this dataset, we introduce EgoLifeQA, a suite of long-context, life-oriented question-answering tasks designed to provide meaningful assistance in daily life by addressing practical questions such as recalling past relevant events, monitoring health habits, and offering personalized recommendations. To address the key technical challenges of (1) developing robust visual-audio models for egocentric data, (2) enabling identity recognition, and (3) facilitating long-context question answering over extensive temporal information, we introduce EgoButler, an integrated system comprising EgoGPT and EgoRAG. EgoGPT is an omni-modal model trained on egocentric datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on egocentric video understanding. EgoRAG is a retrieval-based component that supports answering ultra-long-context questions. Our experimental studies verify their working mechanisms and reveal critical factors and bottlenecks, guiding future improvements. By releasing our datasets, models, and benchmarks, we aim to stimulate further research in egocentric AI assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates. Overall, Video-KTR improves accuracy and interpretability, offering a simple, drop-in extension to RL for complex video reasoning.

However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, extending these capabilities to streaming video inputs, remains challenging, as existing models struggle to simultaneously maintain stable understanding performance, real-time responses, and low GPU memory overhead. To address this challenge, we propose HERMES, a novel training-free architecture for real-time and accurate understanding of video streams. Based on a mechanistic attention investigation, we conceptualize KV cache as a hierarchical memory framework that encapsulates video information across multiple granularities. During inference, HERMES reuses a compact KV cache, enabling efficient streaming understanding under resource constraints. Notably, HERMES requires no auxiliary computations upon the arrival of user queries, thereby guaranteeing real-time responses for continuous video stream interactions, which achieves 10$\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. Even when reducing video tokens by up to 68% compared with uniform sampling, HERMES achieves superior or comparable accuracy across all benchmarks, with up to 11.4% gains on streaming datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Very Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18157v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of always-on personal AI assistants, enabled by all-day wearable devices such as smart glasses, demands a new level of contextual understanding, one that goes beyond short, isolated events to encompass the continuous, longitudinal stream of egocentric video. Achieving this vision requires advances in long-horizon video understanding, where systems must interpret and recall visual and audio information spanning days or even weeks. Existing methods, including large language models and retrieval-augmented generation, are constrained by limited context windows and lack the ability to perform compositional, multi-hop reasoning over very long video streams. In this work, we address these challenges through EGAgent, an enhanced agentic framework centered on entity scene graphs, which represent people, places, objects, and their relationships over time. Our system equips a planning agent with tools for structured search and reasoning over these graphs, as well as hybrid visual and audio search capabilities, enabling detailed, cross-modal, and temporally coherent reasoning. Experiments on the EgoLifeQA and Video-MME (Long) datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on EgoLifeQA (57.5%) and competitive performance on Video-MME (Long) (74.1%) for complex longitudinal video understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Although recent vision-language models perform well on image and short-video reasoning, their spatial reasoning capability in long egocentric sequences remains limited. In this work, we study how explicit spatial signals influence VLM-based video understanding without modifying model architectures or inference procedures. We introduce Sanpo-D, a fine-grained re-annotation of the Google Sanpo dataset, and benchmark multiple VLMs on navigation-oriented spatial queries. To examine input-level inductive bias, we further fuse depth maps with RGB frames and evaluate their impact on spatial reasoning. Our results reveal a trade-off between general-purpose accuracy and spatial specialization, showing that depth-aware and spatially grounded representations can improve performance on safety-critical tasks such as pedestrian and obstruction detection.</p></details> |  |

However, previous approaches often rely on closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected, while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench, surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.</p></details> |  |

To effectively reduce this cost, researchers have proposed various visual token pruning methods. However, existing methods are generally limited, either losing critical visual information prematurely due to pruning in the vision encoder, or leading to information redundancy among the selected tokens due to pruning in the Large Language Models (LLMs). To address these challenges, we propose a Visual and Textual Semantic Collaborative Pruning framework (ViTCoP) that combines redundancy filtering in the vision encoder with step-wise co-pruning within the LLM based on its hierarchical characteristics, to efficiently preserve critical and informationally diverse visual tokens. Meanwhile, to ensure compatibility with acceleration techniques like FlashAttention, we introduce the L2 norm of K-vectors as the token saliency metric in the LLM. Extensive experiments on various Large Vision-Language Models demonstrate that ViTCoP not only achieves state-of-the-art performance surpassing existing methods on both image and video understanding tasks, but also significantly reduces model inference latency and GPU memory consumption. Notably, its performance advantage over other methods becomes even more pronounced under extreme pruning rates.</p></details> |  |

Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding.Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups,achieving superior segmentation transfer and strong downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks such as LVEF prediction.

Mitigating Object-Driven Shortcuts in Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16211v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/KHU-VLL/RCORE</p></details> |

We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.</p></details> |  |

Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 Main Track |

However, existing approaches, such as MAGE, struggle in stochastic or noisy environments, limiting their applicability. In this work, we address these limitations by extending distributional reinforcement learning on continuous state-action spaces to model not only the distribution over scalar state-action value functions but also over their gradients. We refer to this approach as Distributional Sobolev Training. Inspired by Stochastic Value Gradients (SVG), our method utilizes a one-step world model of reward and transition distributions implemented via a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE). The proposed framework is sample-based and employs Max-sliced Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MSMMD) to instantiate the distributional Bellman operator. We prove that the Sobolev-augmented Bellman operator is a contraction with a unique fixed point, and highlight a fundamental smoothness trade-off underlying contraction in gradient-aware RL. To validate our method, we first showcase its effectiveness on a simple stochastic reinforcement learning toy problem, then benchmark its performance on several MuJoCo environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Blueprints of Intelligence: A Functional-Topological Foundation for Perception and Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05089v4)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world phenomena do not generate arbitrary variability: their signals concentrate on compact, low-variability subsets of functional space, enabling rapid generalization from few examples. A small child can recognize a dog after extremely limited exposure because the perceptual manifold of "dog" is compact, structured, and low-dimensional. We formalize this principle through a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations produced by a physical process forms a compact subset of a Banach space, endowed with stable invariants, a finite Hausdorff radius, and an induced continuous perceptual functional. This geometry provides explicit limits on knowledge, conditions for identifiability, and guarantees for generalization from sparse evidence -- properties fundamental to both natural and artificial intelligence. Across electromechanical, electrochemical, and physiological domains, we show that real-world processes consistently generate compact perceptual manifolds with the same geometric characteristics. Their boundaries can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner as the empirical radius saturates with increasing sampling, even when the governing equations are unknown. These results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction. It provides a geometric explanation for why biological learners and self-supervised AI systems can generalize from few observations, and establishes compact perceptual manifolds as a fundamental building block for future AI architectures. Finally, this work unifies biological perception and modern self-supervised models under a single geometric principle: both derive their generalization ability from the compactness and invariants of real-world perceptual manifolds.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures.

Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026. 10 pages.

However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the number of inference tokens increases. This work addresses these issues by proposing a new design principle for attention, viewing it as a two-stage process. The first stage (normalisation) refines standard attention by replacing Softmax with the more numerically stable Softplus followed by $l_{1}$-normalisation. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic scale factor based on invariance entropy. We show that this novel attention mechanism outperforms conventional Softmax attention, and state-of-the-art Softmax-free alternatives. Our second proposal is to introduce a second processing stage (sharpening) which consists of a re-weighting mechanism that amplifies significant attentional weights while diminishing weaker ones. This enables the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens, mitigating the attention sink phenomenon, and fundamentally improving length extrapolation. This novel, two-stage, replacement for self-attention is shown to ensure numerical stability and dramatically improve length extrapolation, maintaining a nearly constant validation loss at 16$\times$ the training length while achieving superior results on challenging long-context retrieval tasks and downstream benchmarks. Furthermore, symbolic regression experiments demonstrate that our method enables models to recover Newton's gravitational law from orbital trajectory sequences, providing evidence that appropriate attention mechanisms are crucial for foundation models to develop genuine physical world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages for ICML 2026</p></details> |
| **[Policy-Driven World Model Adaptation for Robust Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13709v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for data-driven control. Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL (MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a surrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential generalization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL methods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by maximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy to maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective mismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for effective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via offline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial noise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To address these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model alongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving robustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which we solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide theoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally efficient implementations. We benchmark our algorithm on twelve noisy D4RL MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Social World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00559v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to structure and reason about implicit social contexts, as they lack explicit representations for unobserved dynamics such as intentions, beliefs, and evolving social states. In this paper, we introduce the concept of social world models (SWMs) to characterize the complex social dynamics. To operationalize SWMs, we introduce a novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), which captures the evolving states, actions, and mental states of agents, addressing the lack of explicit structure in traditional free-text-based inputs. Through comprehensive experiments across five social reasoning benchmarks, we show that S3AP significantly enhances LLM performance-achieving a +51% improvement on FANToM over OpenAI's o1. Our ablations further reveal that these gains are driven by the explicit modeling of hidden mental states, which proves more effective than a wide range of baseline methods. Finally, we introduce an algorithm for social world models using S3AP, which enables AI agents to build models of their interlocutors and predict their next actions and mental states. Empirically, S3AP-enabled social world models yield up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA multi-turn social interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.</p></details> |  |

Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Patient is not a Moving Document: A World Model Training Paradigm for Longitudinal EHR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22128v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained with next-word-prediction have achieved success as clinical foundation models. Representations from these language backbones yield strong linear probe performance across biomedical tasks, suggesting that patient semantics emerge from next-token prediction at scale. However, this paradigm treats patients as a document to be summarized rather than a dynamical system to be simulated; a patient's trajectory emerges from their state evolving under interventions and time, requiring models that simulate dynamics rather than predict tokens. To address this, we introduce SMB-Structure, a world model for structured EHR that grounds a joint-embedding prediction architecture (JEPA) with next-token prediction (SFT). SFT grounds our model to reconstruct future patient states in token space, while JEPA predicts those futures in latent space from the initial patient representation alone, forcing trajectory dynamics to be encoded before the next state is observed. We validate across two large-scale cohorts: Memorial Sloan Kettering (23,319 oncology patients; 323,000+ patient-years) and INSPECT (19,402 pulmonary embolism patients). Using a linear probe evaluated at multiple points along the disease trajectory, we demonstrate that our training paradigm learns embeddings that capture disease dynamics not recoverable by autoregressive baselines, enabling SMB-Structure to achieve competitive performance on complex tasks characterized by high patient heterogeneity. Model weights are available at https://huggingface.co/standardmodelbio/SMB-v1-1.7B-Structure.</p></details> |  |

While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalization capabilities on unseen geometric configurations, highlighting both its potential for controlled simulation synthesis and current limitations in spatial precision for out-of-distribution samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://technology.robbyant.com/lingbot-va Code: https://github.com/robbyant/lingbot-va</p></details> |

These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project's code can be found at https://github.com/flowersteam/WorldLLM.

We propose a novel multi-agent reasoning framework, referred to as Planning through World Model for Automated Heuristic Design via Self-Evolving LLMs (PathWise), which formulates heuristic generation as a sequential decision process over an entailment graph serving as a compact, stateful memory of the search trajectory. This approach allows the system to carry forward past decisions and reuse or avoid derivation information across generations. A policy agent plans evolutionary actions, a world model agent generates heuristic rollouts conditioned on those actions, and critic agents provide routed reflections summarizing lessons from prior steps, shifting LLM-based AHD from trial-and-error evolution toward state-aware planning through reasoning. Experiments across diverse COPs show that PathWise converges faster to better heuristics, generalizes across different LLM backbones, and scales to larger problem sizes.</p></details> |  |

However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per game, demonstrating superior generalization.

| **[Towards Bridging the Gap between Large-Scale Pretraining and Efficient Finetuning for Humanoid Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21363v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for humanoid control, with on-policy methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) enabling robust training via large-scale parallel simulation and, in some cases, zero-shot deployment to real robots. However, the low sample efficiency of on-policy algorithms limits safe adaptation to new environments. Although off-policy RL and model-based RL have shown improved sample efficiency, the gap between large-scale pretraining and efficient finetuning on humanoids still exists. In this paper, we find that off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with large-batch update and a high Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio, reliably supports large-scale pretraining of humanoid locomotion policies, achieving zero-shot deployment on real robots. For adaptation, we demonstrate that these SAC-pretrained policies can be finetuned in new environments and out-of-distribution tasks using model-based methods. Data collection in the new environment executes a deterministic policy while stochastic exploration is instead confined to a physics-informed world model. This separation mitigates the risks of random exploration during adaptation while preserving exploratory coverage for improvement. Overall, the approach couples the wall-clock efficiency of large-scale simulation during pretraining with the sample efficiency of model-based learning during fine-tuning.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

For reliable deployment, these models must exhibit high physical fidelity, accurately simulating real-world dynamics. Existing physics-based video benchmarks, however, suffer from entanglement, where a single test simultaneously evaluates multiple physical laws and concepts, fundamentally limiting their diagnostic capability. We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://world-bench.github.io/</p></details> |

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.</p></details> |  |

In this end, we present SkyReels-V3, a conditional video generation model, built upon a unified multimodal in-context learning framework with diffusion Transformers. SkyReels-V3 model supports three core generative paradigms within a single architecture: reference images-to-video synthesis, video-to-video extension and audio-guided video generation. (i) reference images-to-video model is designed to produce high-fidelity videos with strong subject identity preservation, temporal coherence, and narrative consistency. To enhance reference adherence and compositional stability, we design a comprehensive data processing pipeline that leverages cross frame pairing, image editing, and semantic rewriting, effectively mitigating copy paste artifacts. During training, an image video hybrid strategy combined with multi-resolution joint optimization is employed to improve generalization and robustness across diverse scenarios. (ii) video extension model integrates spatio-temporal consistency modeling with large-scale video understanding, enabling both seamless single-shot continuation and intelligent multi-shot switching with professional cinematographic patterns. (iii) Talking avatar model supports minute-level audio-conditioned video generation by training first-and-last frame insertion patterns and reconstructing key-frame inference paradigms. On the basis of ensuring visual quality, synchronization of audio and videos has been optimized. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SkyReels-V3 achieves state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance on key metrics including visual quality, instruction following, and specific aspect metrics, approaching leading closed-source systems.

Unlike prior benchmarks that may suffer from contamination in pretraining data, $\texttt{StorySim}$ produces novel, compositional story prompts anchored by a highly controllable $\texttt{Storyboard}$, enabling precise manipulation of character perspectives and events. We use this framework to design first- and second-order ToM tasks alongside WM tasks that control for the ability to track and model mental states. Our experiments across a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that most models perform better on WM tasks than ToM tasks, and that models tend to perform better reasoning with humans compared to inanimate objects. Additionally, our framework enabled us to find evidence of heuristic behavior such as recency bias and an over-reliance on earlier events in the story.

We present HARMONI, a multimodal personalization framework that leverages large language models to enable socially assistive robots to manage long-term multi-user interactions. The framework integrates four key modules: (i) a perception module that identifies active speakers and extracts multimodal input; (ii) a world modeling module that maintains representations of the environment and short-term conversational context; (iii) a user modeling module that updates long-term speaker-specific profiles; and (iv) a generation module that produces contextually grounded and ethically informed responses. Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://thuml.github.io/Reasoning-Visual-World</p></details> |

This study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding tasks, focusing on how visual information is processed and transferred to the textual domain. We compare native multimodal VLMs, models trained from scratch on multimodal data to generate both text and images, and non-native multimodal VLMs, models adapted from pre-trained large language models or capable of generating only text, highlighting key differences in information flow. We find that in native multimodal VLMs, image and text embeddings are more separated within the residual stream. Moreover, VLMs differ in how visual information reaches text: non-native multimodal VLMs exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where information is exchanged through multiple image tokens, whereas models trained natively for joint image and text generation tend to rely on a single post-image token that acts as a narrow gate for visual information. We show that ablating this single token significantly deteriorates image-understanding performance, whereas targeted, token-level interventions reliably steer image semantics and downstream text with fine-grained control.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

This study examines how moral emotional framing by mainstream news channels on YouTube influences user behavior across Korea and the United States. To capture the platform's multimodal nature, combining thumbnail images and video titles, we develop a multimodal moral emotion classifier by fine tuning a vision language model. The model is trained on human annotated multimodal datasets in both languages and applied to approximately 400,000 videos from major news outlets. We analyze engagement levels including views, likes, and comments, representing increasing degrees of commitment. The results show that other condemning rhetoric expressions of moral outrage that criticize others morally consistently increase all forms of engagement across cultures, with effects ranging from passive viewing to active commenting. These findings suggest that moral outrage is a particularly effective emotional strategy, attracting not only attention but also active participation. We discuss concerns about the potential misuse of other condemning rhetoric, as such practices may deepen polarization by reinforcing in group and out group divisions. To facilitate future research and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release our Korean and English multimodal moral emotion classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The Web Conference 2026.

| **[Inference-Time Dynamic Modality Selection for Incomplete Multimodal Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22853v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet its practical deployment is often hindered by incomplete multimodal data. Existing incomplete MDL methods either discard missing modalities, risking the loss of valuable task-relevant information, or recover them, potentially introducing irrelevant noise, leading to the discarding-imputation dilemma. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample. Since direct estimation of such information at test time is intractable due to the unknown data distribution, we theoretically establish a connection between information and the task loss, which we compute at inference time as a tractable proxy. Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on diverse natural and medical image datasets show that DyMo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete/dynamic MDL methods across various missing-data scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com//siyi-wind/DyMo.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages (including appendix), accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

We propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the Findings of EMNLP, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generation Enhances Understanding in Unified Multimodal Models via Multi-Representation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21406v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate both visual understanding and generation within a single framework. Their ultimate aspiration is to create a cycle where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other. While recent post-training methods have successfully leveraged understanding to enhance generation, the reverse direction of utilizing generation to improve understanding remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled Preference-based Cold Start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25801v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%. Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and raising the performance ceiling.

| **[Generalizable Multimodal Large Language Model Editing via Invariant Trajectory Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19700v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods rely on a rigid mapping from parameter or module modifications to output, which causes the generalization limitation in Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose LGM-CL, a local-global multimodal contrastive learning framework that jointly models molecular graphs and textual representations derived from SMILES and chemistry-aware augmented texts. Local functional group information and global molecular topology are captured using AttentiveFP and Graph Transformer encoders, respectively, and aligned through self-supervised contrastive learning. In addition, chemically enriched textual descriptions are contrasted with original SMILES to incorporate physicochemical semantics in a task-agnostic manner. During fine-tuning, molecular fingerprints are further integrated via Dual Cross-attention multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments on MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that LGM-CL achieves consistent and competitive performance across both classification and regression tasks, validating the effectiveness of unified local-global and multimodal representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures.

Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data contamination in the age of LLMs to the temporal and description leakage prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity, leak-free and causally sound design, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing data from live APIs. Our experiments reveal the flaws of the previous benchmarks and the biases in model evaluation, providing new insights into multiple existing forecasting models and LLMs across various evaluation tasks.</p></details> | new version |
| **[DialectGen: Benchmarking and Improving Dialect Robustness in Multimodal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14949v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARE: Multimodal Alignment and Reinforcement for Explainable Deepfake Detection via Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20433v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfake detection is a widely researched topic that is crucial for combating the spread of malicious content, with existing methods mainly modeling the problem as classification or spatial localization. The rapid advancements in generative models impose new demands on Deepfake detection. In this paper, we propose multimodal alignment and reinforcement for explainable Deepfake detection via vision-language models, termed MARE, which aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in Deepfake detection and reasoning. Specifically, MARE designs comprehensive reward functions, incorporating reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to incentivize the generation of text-spatially aligned reasoning content that adheres to human preferences. Besides, MARE introduces a forgery disentanglement module to capture intrinsic forgery traces from high-level facial semantics, thereby improving its authenticity detection capability. We conduct thorough evaluations on the reasoning content generated by MARE. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that MARE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Spectral Reasoning for Frequency-Adaptive Multimodal Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01372v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[FITMM: Adaptive Frequency-Aware Multimodal Recommendation via Information-Theoretic Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22498v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation aims to enhance user preference modeling by leveraging rich item content such as images and text. Yet dominant systems fuse modalities in the spatial domain, obscuring the frequency structure of signals and amplifying misalignment and redundancy. We adopt a spectral information-theoretic view and show that, under an orthogonal transform that approximately block-diagonalizes bandwise covariances, the Gaussian Information Bottleneck objective decouples across frequency bands, providing a principled basis for separate-then-fuse paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose FITMM, a Frequency-aware Information-Theoretic framework for multimodal recommendation. FITMM constructs graph-enhanced item representations, performs modality-wise spectral decomposition to obtain orthogonal bands, and forms lightweight within-band multimodal components. A residual, task-adaptive gate aggregates bands into the final representation. To control redundancy and improve generalization, we regularize training with a frequency-domain IB term that allocates capacity across bands (Wiener-like shrinkage with shut-off of weak bands). We further introduce a cross-modal spectral consistency loss that aligns modalities within each band. The model is jointly optimized with the standard recommendation loss. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FITMM consistently and significantly outperforms advanced baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-OpenFGL: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal Federated Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22416v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal-attributed graphs (MMAGs) provide a unified framework for modeling complex relational data by integrating heterogeneous modalities with graph structures. While centralized learning has shown promising performance, MMAGs in real-world applications are often distributed across isolated platforms and cannot be shared due to privacy concerns or commercial constraints. Federated graph learning (FGL) offers a natural solution for collaborative training under such settings; however, existing studies largely focus on single-modality graphs and do not adequately address the challenges unique to multimodal federated graph learning (MMFGL). To bridge this gap, we present MM-OpenFGL, the first comprehensive benchmark that systematically formalizes the MMFGL paradigm and enables rigorous evaluation. MM-OpenFGL comprises 19 multimodal datasets spanning 7 application domains, 8 simulation strategies capturing modality and topology variations, 6 downstream tasks, and 57 state-of-the-art methods implemented through a modular API. Extensive experiments investigate MMFGL from the perspectives of necessity, effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency, offering valuable insights for future research on MMFGL.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[UEval: A Benchmark for Unified Multimodal Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22155v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce UEval, a benchmark to evaluate unified models, i.e., models capable of generating both images and text. UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-DeepResearch: Incentivizing DeepResearch Capability in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22060v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a broad range of vision tasks. However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

| **[$G^2$-Reader: Dual Evolving Graphs for Multimodal Document QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22055v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation is a practical paradigm for question answering over long documents, but it remains brittle for multimodal reading where text, tables, and figures are interleaved across many pages. First, flat chunking breaks document-native structure and cross-modal alignment, yielding semantic fragments that are hard to interpret in isolation. Second, even iterative retrieval can fail in long contexts by looping on partial evidence or drifting into irrelevant sections as noise accumulates, since each step is guided only by the current snippet without a persistent global search state. We introduce $G^2$-Reader, a dual-graph system, to address both issues. It evolves a Content Graph to preserve document-native structure and cross-modal semantics, and maintains a Planning Graph, an agentic directed acyclic graph of sub-questions, to track intermediate findings and guide stepwise navigation for evidence completion. On VisDoMBench across five multimodal domains, $G^2$-Reader with Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct reaches 66.21\% average accuracy, outperforming strong baselines and a standalone GPT-5 (53.08\%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Multimodal Complementarity for Single-Frame Action Anticipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22039v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human action anticipation is commonly treated as a video understanding problem, implicitly assuming that dense temporal information is required to reason about future actions. In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating what can be achieved when action anticipation is constrained to a single visual observation. We ask a fundamental question: how much information about the future is already encoded in a single frame, and how can it be effectively exploited? Building on our prior work on Action Anticipation at a Glimpse (AAG), we conduct a systematic investigation of single-frame action anticipation enriched with complementary sources of information. We analyze the contribution of RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, and semantic representations of past actions, and investigate how different multimodal fusion strategies, keyframe selection policies and past-action history sources influence anticipation performance. Guided by these findings, we consolidate the most effective design choices into AAG+, a refined single-frame anticipation framework. Despite operating on a single frame, AAG+ consistently improves upon the original AAG and achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, that of state-of-the-art video-based methods on challenging anticipation benchmarks including IKEA-ASM, Meccano and Assembly101. Our results offer new insights into the limits and potential of single-frame action anticipation, and clarify when dense temporal modeling is necessary and when a carefully selected glimpse is sufficient.</p></details> |  |

However, pretraining video world models for scene understanding has so far brought only limited improvements. This limitation is compounded by the inherent ambiguity of driving: each scene typically provides only a single human trajectory, making it difficult to learn multimodal behaviors. In this work, we propose Drive-JEPA, a framework that integrates Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) with multimodal trajectory distillation for end-to-end driving. First, we adapt V-JEPA for end-to-end driving, pretraining a ViT encoder on large-scale driving videos to produce predictive representations aligned with trajectory planning. Second, we introduce a proposal-centric planner that distills diverse simulator-generated trajectories alongside human trajectories, with a momentum-aware selection mechanism to promote stable and safe behavior. When evaluated on NAVSIM, the V-JEPA representation combined with a simple transformer-based decoder outperforms prior methods by 3 PDMS in the perception-free setting. The complete Drive-JEPA framework achieves 93.3 PDMS on v1 and 87.8 EPDMS on v2, setting a new state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Existing MLLM unlearning methods largely adopt approaches developed for LLMs. They treat all answer tokens uniformly, disregarding their varying importance in the unlearning process. Moreover, these methods focus exclusively on the language modality, disregarding visual cues that indicate key tokens in answers. In this paper, after formulating the problem of unlearning in multimodal question answering for MLLMs, we propose Visual-Guided Key-Token Regularization (ViKeR). We leverage irrelevant visual inputs to predict ideal post-unlearning token-level distributions and use these distributions to regularize the unlearning process, thereby prioritizing key tokens. Further, we define key tokens in unlearning via information entropy and discuss ViKeR's effectiveness through token-level gradient reweighting, which amplifies updates on key tokens. Experiments on MLLMU and CLEAR benchmarks demonstrate that our method effectively performs unlearning while mitigating forgetting and maintaining response coherence.</p></details> |  |

By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches assume equal contribution of modality and random missing patterns, neglecting inherent uncertainty in medical data acquisition. In this regard, we propose the Aleatoric Uncertainty Modeling (AUM) that explicitly quantifies unimodal aleatoric uncertainty to address missing modalities. Specifically, AUM models each unimodal representation as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to capture aleatoric uncertainty and enable principled modality reliability quantification. To adaptively aggregate captured information, we develop a dynamic message-passing mechanism within a bipartite patient-modality graph using uncertainty-aware aggregation mechanism. Through this process, missing modalities are naturally accommodated, while more reliable information from available modalities is dynamically emphasized to guide representation generation. Our AUM framework achieves an improvement of 2.26% AUC-ROC on MIMIC-IV mortality prediction and 2.17% gain on eICU, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Multimodal Representation Learning in Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21941v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous data into unified patient representations to support clinical outcome prediction. However, real-world medical datasets commonly contain systematic biases from multiple sources, which poses significant challenges for medical multimodal representation learning. Existing approaches typically focus on effective multimodal fusion, neglecting inherent biased features that affect the generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Feature Decorrelation Framework that identifies and handles the biases through structural causal analysis introduced by latent confounders. Our method employs a causal-biased decorrelation framework with dual-stream neural networks to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations, utilizing generalized cross-entropy loss and mutual information minimization for effective decorrelation. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing medical multimodal learning methods. Comprehensive experiments on MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in selective prediction performance, based on area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the Findings of EMNLP, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable Multimodal Large Language Model Editing via Invariant Trajectory Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19700v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods rely on a rigid mapping from parameter or module modifications to output, which causes the generalization limitation in Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce MIDI-LLaMA, the first instruction-following MLLM for symbolic music understanding. Our approach aligns the MIDI encoder MusicBERT and Llama-3-8B via a two-stage pipeline comprising feature alignment and instruction tuning. To support training, we design a scalable annotation pipeline that annotates GiantMIDI-Piano with fine-grained metadata, resulting in a MIDI-text dataset. Compared with the baseline trained on converting MIDI into ABC notation under the same instruction-tuning procedure, MIDI-LLaMA substantially outperforms in captioning and semantic alignment in question answering. Human evaluation further confirms the advantages of MIDI-LLaMA in music understanding, emotion recognition, creativity, and overall preference. These findings demonstrate that incorporating symbolic music into large language models enhances their capacity for musical understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Concise Geometric Description as a Bridge: Unleashing the Potential of LLM for Plane Geometry Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21164v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plane Geometry Problem Solving (PGPS) is a multimodal reasoning task that aims to solve a plane geometric problem based on a geometric diagram and problem textual descriptions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong reasoning skills, their direct application to PGPS is hindered by their inability to process visual diagrams. Existing works typically fine-tune Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) end-to-end on large-scale PGPS data to enhance visual understanding and reasoning simultaneously. However, such joint optimization may compromise base LLMs' inherent reasoning capability. In this work, we observe that LLM itself is potentially a powerful PGPS solver when appropriately formulating visual information as textual descriptions. We propose to train a MLLM Interpreter to generate geometric descriptions for the visual diagram, and an off-the-shelf LLM is utilized to perform reasoning. Specifically, we choose Conditional Declaration Language (CDL) as the geometric description as its conciseness eases the MLLM Interpreter training. The MLLM Interpreter is fine-tuned via CoT (Chain-of-Thought)-augmented SFT followed by GRPO to generate CDL. Instead of using a conventional solution-based reward that compares the reasoning result with the ground-truth answer, we design CDL matching rewards to facilitate more effective GRPO training, which provides more direct and denser guidance for CDL generation. To support training, we construct a new dataset, Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, by manually reviewing Formalgeo7k v2 and incorporating CoT annotations. Extensive experiments on Formalgeo7k-Rec-CoT, Unigeo, and MathVista show our method (finetuned on only 5.5k data) performs favorably against leading open-source and closed-source MLLMs.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing spatial audio models, conversely, are constrained to fixed microphone geometries, preventing deployment across diverse devices. We present PhaseCoder, a transformer-only spatial audio encoder that is agnostic to microphone geometry. PhaseCoder takes raw multichannel audio and microphone coordinates as inputs to perform localization and produces robust spatial embeddings. We demonstrate that Gemma 3n LLM can be fine-tuned to reason over "Spatial Audio Tokens" produced by PhaseCoder. We show our encoder achieves state-of-the-art results on microphone-invariant localization benchmarks and, for the first time, enables an LLM to perform complex spatial reasoning and targeted transcription tasks from an arbitrary microphone array.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a suite of tasks and release TV-MMPC, a new annotated dataset, for multimodal conversation structure understanding. Our evaluation reveals that while all multimodal LLMs outperform our heuristic baseline, even the best-performing model we consider experiences a substantial drop in performance when character identities of the conversation are anonymized. Beyond evaluation, we carry out a sociolinguistic analysis of 350,842 utterances in TVQA. We find that while female characters initiate conversations at rates in proportion to their speaking time, they are 1.2 times more likely than men to be cast as an addressee or side-participant, and the presence of side-participants shifts the conversational register from personal to social.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to EACL 2026 main conference; 22 pages, 9 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors. Specifically, GDCNet computes semantic and sentiment discrepancies between the generated objective description and the original text, alongside measuring visual-textual fidelity. These discrepancy features are then fused with visual and textual representations via a gated module to adaptively balance modality contributions. Extensive experiments on MSD benchmarks demonstrate GDCNet's superior accuracy and robustness, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the MMSD2.0 benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2026 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2026)</p></details> |

In contrast, language models often lack this capability, limiting their effectiveness in multimodal interactions. As an initial step to address this gap, we present AuditoryBench++, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating auditory knowledge and reasoning in text-only settings. The benchmark encompasses tasks that range from basic auditory comparisons to contextually grounded reasoning, enabling fine-grained analysis of how models process and integrate auditory concepts. In addition, we introduce AIR-CoT, a novel auditory imagination reasoning method that generates and integrates auditory information during inference through span detection with special tokens and knowledge injection. Extensive experiments with recent LLMs and Multimodal LLMs demonstrate that AIR-CoT generally outperforms both the off-the-shelf models and those augmented with auditory knowledge.

Traditional survey methods rely on diver inspections, which are hazardous and limited in scalability. This work investigates automated classification of biofouling severity on the Level of Fouling (LoF) scale using both custom computer vision models and large multimodal language models (LLMs). Convolutional neural networks, transformer-based segmentation, and zero-shot LLMs were evaluated on an expert-labelled dataset from the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries. Computer vision models showed high accuracy at extreme LoF categories but struggled with intermediate levels due to dataset imbalance and image framing. LLMs, guided by structured prompts and retrieval, achieved competitive performance without training and provided interpretable outputs. The results demonstrate complementary strengths across approaches and suggest that hybrid methods integrating segmentation coverage with LLM reasoning offer a promising pathway toward scalable and interpretable biofouling assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Austr...</summary><p>Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation, ACRA2025 13 Pages, 8 Figures</p></details> |
| **[GHOST: Hallucination-Inducing Image Generation for Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25178v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generation-Augmented Generation: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Private Knowledge Injection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08209v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In domains such as biomedicine, materials, and finance, high-stakes deployment of large language models (LLMs) requires injecting private, domain-specific knowledge that is proprietary, fast-evolving, and under-represented in public pretraining. However, the two dominant paradigms for private knowledge injection each have pronounced drawbacks: fine-tuning is expensive to iterate, and continual updates risk catastrophic forgetting and general-capability regression; retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) keeps the base model intact but is brittle in specialized private corpora due to chunk-induced evidence fragmentation, retrieval drift, and long-context pressure that yields query-dependent prompt inflation. Inspired by how multimodal LLMs align heterogeneous modalities into a shared semantic space, we propose Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG), which treats private expertise as an additional expert modality and injects it via a compact, representation-level interface aligned to the frozen base model, avoiding prompt-time evidence serialization while enabling plug-and-play specialization and scalable multi-domain composition with reliable selective activation. Across two private scientific QA benchmarks (immunology adjuvant and catalytic materials) and mixed-domain evaluations, GAG improves specialist performance over strong RAG baselines by 15.34% and 14.86% on the two benchmarks, respectively, while maintaining performance on six open general benchmarks and enabling near-oracle selective activation for scalable multi-domain deployment.

| **[MMR-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multimodal LLM Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17814v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet heterogeneity in architecture, alignment strategies, and efficiency means that no single model is uniformly superior across tasks. In practical deployments, workloads span lightweight OCR to complex multimodal reasoning; using one MLLM for all queries either over-provisions compute on easy instances or sacrifices accuracy on hard ones. Query-level model selection (routing) addresses this tension, but extending routing from text-only LLMs to MLLMs is nontrivial due to modality fusion, wide variation in computational cost across models, and the absence of a standardized, budget-aware evaluation. We present MMR-Bench, a unified benchmark that isolates the multimodal routing problem and enables comparison under fixed candidate sets and cost models. MMR-Bench provides (i) a controlled environment with modality-aware inputs and variable compute budgets, (ii) a broad suite of vision-language tasks covering OCR, general VQA, and multimodal math reasoning, and (iii) strong single-model reference, oracle upper bounds, and representative routing policies. Using MMR-Bench, we show that incorporating multimodal signals improves routing quality. Empirically, these cues improve the cost-accuracy frontier and enable the routed system to exceed the strongest single model's accuracy at roughly 33% of its cost. Furthermore, policies trained on a subset of models and tasks generalize zero-shot to new datasets and text-only benchmarks without retuning, establishing MMR-Bench as a foundation for studying adaptive multimodal model selection and efficient MLLM deployment. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Hunter-Wrynn/MMR-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Contrast to Commonality: Audio Commonality Captioning for Enhanced Audio-Text Cross-modal Understanding in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01659v3)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio Captioning (AC) plays a pivotal role in enhancing audio-text cross-modal understanding during the pretraining and finetuning of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To strengthen this alignment, recent works propose Audio Difference Captioning (ADC), which takes multiple audio inputs and encourages the model to describe their differences, thereby promoting fine-grained discrimination. However, despite its effectiveness, ADC introduces a semantic gap between input audios-often rich in diverse events-and the brief, difference-focused short caption. This deviation from AC-style task causes a mismatch with the pretraining objective, leading to catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose Audio Commonality Captioning (ACC), a comparably challenging but gentler alternative that guides the model to capture shared semantics across audio clips rather than detailed differences. Experiments show that ACC not only improves audio-text understanding on captioning benchmarks but also better preserves general capabilities across diverse speech and music tasks, confirming its ability to enable more robust cross-modal understanding and achieve a better balance between generalization and task-specific performance in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Superficial Unlearning: Sharpness-Aware Robust Erasure of Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16527v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal LLMs are powerful but prone to object hallucinations, which describe non-existent entities and harm reliability. While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARE significantly outperforms baselines in erasure efficacy while preserving general generation quality. Crucially, it maintains persistent hallucination suppression against relearning and parameter updates, validating the effectiveness of geometric stabilization.</p></details> |  |

Its TVPS-4 framework categorizes and tests human perception into seven skills such as visual discrimination, and form constancy. Do Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) match up to humans in basic perception? Even though there are many benchmarks that evaluate MLLMs on advanced reasoning and knowledge skills, there is limited research that focuses evaluation on simple perception. In response, we introduce Percept-V, a dataset containing 6000 program-generated uncontaminated images divided into 30 domains, where each domain tests one or more TVPS-4 skills. Our focus is on perception, so we make our domains quite simple and the reasoning and knowledge required for solving them are minimal. Since modern-day MLLMs can solve much more complex tasks, our a-priori expectation is that they will solve these domains very easily. Contrary to our belief, our experiments show a weak performance of SoTA proprietary and open-source MLLMs compared to very high human performance on Percept-V. We find that as number of objects in the image increases, performance goes down rather fast. Our experiments also identify the perception skills that are considerably harder for all models.</p></details> |  |

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of the current state of efficient MLLMs. Specifically, we summarize the timeline of representative efficient MLLMs, research state of efficient structures and strategies, and the applications.

However, their further adoption is hindered by two coupled challenges: (i) the absence of standardized evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess progress in the field and compare different approaches; and (ii) natural language descriptions are inherently underspecified, so multiple visualizations may be valid for the same query. To address these issues, we introduce VegaChat, a framework for generating, validating, and assessing declarative visualizations from natural language. We propose two complementary metrics: Spec Score, a deterministic metric that measures specification-level similarity without invoking an LLM, and Vision Score, a library-agnostic, image-based metric that leverages a multimodal LLM to assess chart similarity and prompt compliance. We evaluate VegaChat on the NLV Corpus and on the annotated subset of ChartLLM. VegaChat achieves near-zero rates of invalid or empty visualizations, while Spec Score and Vision Score exhibit strong correlation with human judgments (Pearson 0.65 and 0.71, respectively), indicating that the proposed metrics support consistent, cross-library comparison.

Despite the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each puzzle is procedurally generated and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns, robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, to develop clinically useful multimodal LLM tools, high-quality benchmarks curated by domain experts are essential. To curate released and holdout datasets of 100 chest radiographic studies each and propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted expert labeling procedure to allow radiologists to label studies more efficiently. A total of 13,735 deidentified chest radiographs and their corresponding reports from the MIDRC were used. GPT-4o extracted abnormal findings from the reports, which were then mapped to 12 benchmark labels with a locally hosted LLM (Phi-4-Reasoning). From these studies, 1,000 were sampled on the basis of the AI-suggested benchmark labels for expert review; the sampling algorithm ensured that the selected studies were clinically relevant and captured a range of difficulty levels. Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked "Agree all", "Agree mostly" or "Disagree" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected "Agree All" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is used exclusively by RSNA to independently evaluate different models. A benchmark of 200 chest radiographic studies with 12 benchmark labels was created and made publicly available https://imaging.rsna.org, with each chest radiograph verified by three radiologists. In addition, an AI-assisted labeling procedure was developed to help radiologists label at scale, minimize unnecessary omissions, and support a semicollaborative environment.</p></details> |  |

We present an exploratory study on aligning MLLMs with speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in analysing joint attention in parent-child interactions, a key construct in early social-communicative development. Drawing on interviews and video annotations with three SLPs, we characterise how observational cues of gaze, action, and vocalisation inform their reasoning processes. We then test whether an MLLM can approximate this workflow through a two-stage prompting approach, separating observation from judgement. Our findings reveal that alignment is more robust at the observation layer, where experts share common descriptors, than at the judgement layer, where interpretive criteria diverge. We position this work as a case-based probe into expert-AI alignment in complex social behaviour, highlighting both the feasibility and the challenges of applying MLLMs to socially situated interaction analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2026. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2506.05879</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce FutureOmni, the first benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal future forecasting from audio-visual environments. The evaluated models are required to perform cross-modal causal and temporal reasoning, as well as effectively leverage internal knowledge to predict future events. FutureOmni is constructed via a scalable LLM-assisted, human-in-the-loop pipeline and contains 919 videos and 1,034 multiple-choice QA pairs across 8 primary domains. Evaluations on 13 omni-modal and 7 video-only models show that current systems struggle with audio-visual future prediction, particularly in speech-heavy scenarios, with the best accuracy of 64.8% achieved by Gemini 3 Flash. To mitigate this limitation, we curate a 7K-sample instruction-tuning dataset and propose an Omni-Modal Future Forecasting (OFF) training strategy.

We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning ("thinking-with-images"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%).

| **[SiLVR: A Simple Language-based Video Reasoning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24869v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in test-time optimization have led to remarkable reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to solve highly complex problems in math and coding. However, the reasoning capabilities of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still significantly lag, especially for complex video-language tasks. To address this issue, we present SILVR, a Simple Language-based Video Reasoning framework that decomposes complex video understanding into two stages. In the first stage, SILVR transforms raw video into language-based representations using multisensory inputs, such as short clip captions and audio/speech subtitles. In the second stage, language descriptions are fed into a powerful reasoning LLM to solve complex video-language understanding tasks. To handle long-context multisensory inputs, we use an Adaptive Context Reduction scheme, which dynamically determines the temporal granularity with which to sample the tokens. Our simple, modular, and training-free video reasoning framework achieves the best-reported results on Video-MME (long), Video-MMMU (comprehension), Video-MMLU, CGBench, and EgoLife. Furthermore, our empirical study focused on video reasoning capabilities shows that, despite not being explicitly trained on video, strong reasoning LLMs can effectively aggregate multisensory input information from video, speech, and audio for complex temporal, causal, long-context, and knowledge acquisition reasoning tasks in video.

| **[Simulating the Visual World with Artificial Intelligence: A Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08585v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems. An up-to-date list of related works is maintained at this link.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://world-model-roadmap.github.io/ Github Repo: https://github.com/ziqihuangg/Awesome-From-Video-Generation-to-World-Model</p></details> |
| **[DIVINE: Coordinating Multimodal Disentangled Representations for Oro-Facial Neurological Disorder Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07014v1)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a multimodal framework for predicting neuro-facial disorders by capturing both vocal and facial cues. We hypothesize that explicitly disentangling shared and modality-specific representations within multimodal foundation model embeddings can enhance clinical interpretability and generalization. To validate this hypothesis, we propose DIVINE a fully disentangled multimodal framework that operates on representations extracted from state-of-the-art (SOTA) audio and video foundation models, incorporating hierarchical variational bottlenecks, sparse gated fusion, and learnable symptom tokens. DIVINE operates in a multitask learning setup to jointly predict diagnostic categories (Healthy Control,ALS, Stroke) and severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe). The model is trained using synchronized audio and video inputs and evaluated on the Toronto NeuroFace dataset under full (audio-video) as well as single-modality (audio-only and video-only) test conditions. Our proposed approach, DIVINE achieves SOTA result, with the DeepSeek-VL2 and TRILLsson combination reaching 98.26% accuracy and 97.51% F1-score. Under modality-constrained scenarios, the framework performs well, showing strong generalization when tested with video-only or audio-only inputs. It consistently yields superior performance compared to unimodal models and baseline fusion techniques. To the best of our knowledge, DIVINE is the first framework that combines cross-modal disentanglement, adaptive fusion, and multitask learning to comprehensively assess neurological disorders using synchronized speech and facial video.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2026</p></details> |
| **[Wow, wo, val! A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04137v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGOnline: Segment Any Gaussians Online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08219v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit 3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation remains challenging. Existing segmentation approaches typically rely on high-dimensional feature lifting, which causes costly optimization, implicit semantics, and task-specific constraints. We present \textbf{Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline)}, a unified, zero-shot framework that achieves real-time, cross-view consistent segmentation without scene-specific training. SAGOnline decouples the monolithic segmentation problem into lightweight sub-tasks. By integrating video foundation models (e.g., SAM 2), we first generate temporally consistent 2D masks across rendered views. Crucially, instead of learning continuous feature fields, we introduce a \textbf{Rasterization-aware Geometric Consensus} mechanism that leverages the traceability of the Gaussian rasterization pipeline. This allows us to deterministically map 2D predictions to explicit, discrete 3D primitive labels in real-time. This discrete representation eliminates the memory and computational burden of feature distillation, enabling instant inference. Extensive evaluations on NVOS and SPIn-NeRF benchmarks demonstrate that SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (92.7\% and 95.2\% mIoU) while operating at the fastest speed at 27 ms per frame. By providing a flexible interface for diverse foundation models, our framework supports instant prompt, instance, and semantic segmentation, paving the way for interactive 3D understanding in AR/VR and robotics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10675v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Much 3D Do Video Foundation Models Encode?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19949v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vidfm-3d-probe.github.io</p></details> |
| **[A Study of Finetuning Video Transformers for Multi-view Geometry Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18684v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an investigation of vision transformer learning for multi-view geometry tasks, such as optical flow estimation, by fine-tuning video foundation models. Unlike previous methods that involve custom architectural designs and task-specific pretraining, our research finds that general-purpose models pretrained on videos can be readily transferred to multi-view problems with minimal adaptation. The core insight is that general-purpose attention between patches learns temporal and spatial information for geometric reasoning. We demonstrate that appending a linear decoder to the Transformer backbone produces satisfactory results, and iterative refinement can further elevate performance to stateof-the-art levels. This conceptually simple approach achieves top cross-dataset generalization results for optical flow estimation with end-point error (EPE) of 0.69, 1.78, and 3.15 on the Sintel clean, Sintel final, and KITTI datasets, respectively. Our method additionally establishes a new record on the online test benchmark with EPE values of 0.79, 1.88, and F1 value of 3.79. Applications to 3D depth estimation and stereo matching also show strong performance, illustrating the versatility of video-pretrained models in addressing geometric vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 20206, Project website: geovit-aaai26.github.io</p></details> |
| **[MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14691v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Generative Spatiotemporal Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12508v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore spatiotemporal data augmentation using video foundation models to diversify both camera viewpoints and scene dynamics. Unlike existing approaches based on simple geometric transforms or appearance perturbations, our method leverages off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate realistic 3D spatial and temporal variations from a given image dataset. Incorporating these synthesized video clips as supplemental training data yields consistent performance gains in low-data settings, such as UAV-captured imagery where annotations are scarce. Beyond empirical improvements, we provide practical guidelines for (i) choosing an appropriate spatiotemporal generative setup, (ii) transferring annotations to synthetic frames, and (iii) addressing disocclusion - regions newly revealed and unlabeled in generated views. Experiments on COCO subsets and UAV-captured datasets show that, when applied judiciously, spatiotemporal augmentation broadens the data distribution along axes underrepresented by traditional and prior generative methods, offering an effective lever for improving model performance in data-scarce regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[InternVideo-Next: Towards General Video Foundation Models without Video-Text Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01342v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[HanDyVQA: A Video QA Benchmark for Fine-Grained Hand-Object Interaction Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00885v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-object interaction (HOI) inherently involves dynamics where human manipulations produce distinct spatio-temporal effects on objects. However, existing semantic HOI benchmarks focused either on manipulation or on the resulting effects at a coarse level, lacking fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning to capture the underlying dynamics in HOI. We introduce HanDyVQA, a fine-grained video question-answering benchmark that comprehensively covers both the manipulation and effect aspects of HOI. HanDyVQA comprises six complementary question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, and Object Parts), totalling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs. Collected QA pairs recognizing manipulation styles, hand/object motions, and part-level state changes. HanDyVQA also includes 10.3K segmentation masks for Objects and Object Parts questions, enabling the evaluation of object/part-level reasoning in video object segmentation. We evaluated recent video foundation models on our benchmark and found that even the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, reached only 73% average accuracy, which is far from human performance (97%). Further analysis shows the remaining challenges in spatial relationship, motion, and part-level geometric understanding. We also found that integrating explicit HOI-related cues into visual features improves performance, offering insights for developing future models with a deeper understanding of HOI dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://masatate.github.io/HanDyVQA-project-page/</p></details> |

Existing public datasets typically require manual YouTube crawling, which yields low usable volume due to link rot and access limits, and raises licensing uncertainty. This work addresses this challenge by introducing ViMix-14M, a curated multi-source video-text dataset of around 14 million pairs that provides crawl-free, download-ready access and long-form, high-quality captions tightly aligned to video. ViMix-14M is built by merging diverse open video sources, followed by unified de-duplication and quality filtering, and a multi-granularity, ground-truth-guided re-captioning pipeline that refines descriptions to better match actions, scenes, and temporal structure. We evaluate the dataset by multimodal retrieval, text-to-video generation, and video question answering tasks, observing consistent improvements over counterpart datasets. We hope this work can help removing the key barrier to training and fine-tuning open-source video foundation models, and provide insights of building high-quality and generalizable video-text datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Synthetic Video Realism Enhancement via Structure-aware Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14719v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wyf0824.github.io/Video_Realism_Enhancement/</p></details> |
| **[Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.</p></details> |  |

LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205v4)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EUSIPCO 2025 - 5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Pretrain to Pain: Adversarial Vulnerability of Video Foundation Models Without Task Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07049v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Video Foundation Models (VFMs) has significantly advanced various video-related tasks, either through task-specific models or Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the open accessibility of VFMs also introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video models.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Oral presentation)</p></details> |

We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges. Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo), specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG) consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.</p></details> | 41 pages, 26 figures |

Despite the established strong imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception, outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.</p></details> |  |

| **[GenLit: Reformulating Single-Image Relighting as Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11224v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the implicit scene understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows and inter-reflections. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape, and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or ray-tracing. .

| **[Breakdance Video classification in the age of Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20287v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language models have seen huge application in several sports use-cases recently. Most of these works have been targeted towards a limited subset of popular sports like soccer, cricket, basketball etc; focusing on generative tasks like visual question answering, highlight generation. This work analyzes the applicability of the modern video foundation models (both encoder and decoder) for a very niche but hugely popular dance sports - breakdance. Our results show that Video Encoder models continue to outperform state-of-the-art Video Language Models for prediction tasks. We provide insights on how to choose the encoder model and provide a thorough analysis into the workings of a finetuned decoder model for breakdance video classification.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Advances in 4D Representation: Geometry, Motion, and Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19255v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation, application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction. Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available, as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward.

| **[TTOM: Test-Time Optimization and Memorization for Compositional Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07940v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy, and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work, we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation on the fly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ttom-t2v.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Inferring Dynamic Physical Properties from Video Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02311v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.</p></details> |  |
