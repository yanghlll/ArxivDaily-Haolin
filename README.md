| **[UniT: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Test-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12279v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.</p></details> |  |

It decouples understanding and generation via task-specific low-rank adapters, avoiding objective interference and representation entanglement, while a novel reference-based multimodal preference alignment optimizes relative outcomes under identical conditioning, improving faithfulness and controllability without large-scale retraining. UniDFlpw achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to tasks including inpainting, in-context image generation, reference-based editing, and compositional generation, despite no explicit task-specific training.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepGen 1.0: A Lightweight Unified Multimodal Model for Advancing Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12205v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamID-Omni: Unified Framework for Controllable Human-Centric Audio-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12160v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://guoxu1233.github.io/DreamID-Omni/</p></details> |
| **[PosterOmni: Generalized Artistic Poster Creation via Task Distillation and Unified Reward Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12127v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-poster generation is a high-demand task requiring not only local adjustments but also high-level design understanding. Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniVL-Guard: Towards Unified Vision-Language Forgery Detection and Grounding via Balanced RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10687v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing forgery detection methods are often limited to uni-modal or bi-modal settings, failing to handle the interleaved text, images, and videos prevalent in real-world misinformation. To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits zero-shot robust generalization across out-of-domain scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, DeepFake Detection</p></details> |
| **[Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11940v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in time series forecasting, their vulnerability to adversarial examples remains a critical security concern. However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints. Moreover, our method also exhibits superior transfer attack performance even without TUAP constraints, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in generating adversarial perturbations for time series forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Behavior Atlas: Benchmarking Unified Psychological and Social Behavior Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04899v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using intelligent systems to perceive psychological and social behaviors, that is, the underlying affective, cognitive, and pathological states that are manifested through observable behaviors and social interactions, remains a challenge due to their complex, multifaceted, and personalized nature. Existing work tackling these dimensions through specialized datasets and single-task systems often miss opportunities for scalability, cross-task transfer, and broader generalization. To address this gap, we curate Human Behavior Atlas, a unified benchmark of diverse behavioral tasks designed to support the development of foundation models for understanding psychological and social behaviors. Human Behavior Atlas comprises over 100,000 samples spanning text, audio, and visual modalities, covering tasks on affective states, cognitive states, pathologies, and social processes. Our unification efforts can reduce redundancy and cost, enable training to scale efficiently across tasks, and enhance generalization of behavioral features across domains. On Human Behavior Atlas, we train three models: Omnisapiens-7B SFT, Omnisapiens-7B BAM, and Omnisapiens-7B RL. We show that training on Human Behavior Atlas enables models to consistently outperform existing multimodal LLMs across diverse behavioral tasks. Pretraining on Human Behavior Atlas also improves transfer to novel behavioral datasets; with the targeted use of behavioral descriptors yielding meaningful performance gains. The benchmark, models, and codes can be found at: https://github.com/MIT-MI/human_behavior_atlas.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[RLinf-USER: A Unified and Extensible System for Real-World Online Policy Learning in Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07837v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online policy learning directly in the physical world is a promising yet challenging direction for embodied intelligence. Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and long-horizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge-cloud collaboration with large models, and long-running asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatientHub: A Unified Framework for Patient Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11684v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models increasingly power role-playing applications, simulating patients has become a valuable tool for training counselors and scaling therapeutic assessment. However, prior work is fragmented: existing approaches rely on incompatible, non-standardized data formats, prompts, and evaluation metrics, hindering reproducibility and fair comparison. In this paper, we introduce PatientHub, a unified and modular framework that standardizes the definition, composition, and deployment of simulated patients. To demonstrate PatientHub's utility, we implement several representative patient simulation methods as case studies, showcasing how our framework supports standardized cross-method evaluation and the seamless integration of custom evaluation metrics. We further demonstrate PatientHub's extensibility by prototyping two new simulator variants, highlighting how PatientHub accelerates method development by eliminating infrastructure overhead. By consolidating existing work into a single reproducible pipeline, PatientHub lowers the barrier to developing new simulation methods and facilitates cross-method and cross-model benchmarking. Our framework provides a practical foundation for future datasets, methods, and benchmarks in patient-centered dialogue, and the code is publicly available via https://github.com/Sahandfer/PatientHub.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Unifying Stable Optimization and Reference Regularization in RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11523v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has advanced alignment capabilities significantly but remains hindered by two core challenges: \textbf{reward hacking} and \textbf{stable optimization}. Current solutions independently address these issues through separate regularization strategies, specifically a KL-divergence penalty against a supervised fine-tuned model ($π_0$) to mitigate reward hacking, and policy ratio clipping towards the current policy ($π_t$) to promote stable alignment. However, the implicit trade-off arising from simultaneously regularizing towards both $π_0$ and $π_t$ remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce a unified regularization approach that explicitly balances the objectives of preventing reward hacking and maintaining stable policy updates. Our simple yet principled alignment objective yields a weighted supervised fine-tuning loss with a superior trade-off, which demonstrably improves both alignment results and implementation complexity. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate that our method consistently outperforms RLHF and online preference learning methods, achieving enhanced alignment performance and stability.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[3DXTalker: Unifying Identity, Lip Sync, Emotion, and Spatial Dynamics in Expressive 3D Talking Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10516v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven 3D talking avatar generation is increasingly important in virtual communication, digital humans, and interactive media, where avatars must preserve identity, synchronize lip motion with speech, express emotion, and exhibit lifelike spatial dynamics, collectively defining a broader objective of expressivity. However, achieving this remains challenging due to insufficient training data with limited subject identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability. In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation. These cues are unified by a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics. Moreover, 3DXTalker also enables natural head-pose motion generation while supporting stylized control via prompt-based conditioning. Extensive experiments show that 3DXTalker integrates lip synchronization, emotional expression, and head-pose dynamics within a unified framework, achieves superior performance in 3D talking avatar generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradients Must Earn Their Influence: Unifying SFT with Generalized Entropic Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11424v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) applies uniform token-level weighting. This rigidity creates a two-fold failure mode: (i) overemphasizing low-probability targets can amplify gradients on noisy supervision and disrupt robust priors, and (ii) uniform weighting provides weak sharpening when the model is already confident. Existing methods fail to resolve the resulting plasticity--stability dilemma, often suppressing necessary learning signals alongside harmful ones. To address this issue, we unify token-level SFT objectives within a generalized deformed-log family and expose a universal gate $\times$ error gradient structure, where the gate controls how much the model trusts its current prediction. By employing the Cayley transform, we map the model's continuously evolving uncertainty onto a continuous focus trajectory, which enables seamless interpolation between scenarios involving uncertain novel concepts and those involving well-established knowledge. We then introduce Dynamic Entropy Fine-Tuning (DEFT), a parameter-free objective that modulates the trust gate using distribution concentration (Rényi-2 entropy) as a practical proxy for the model's predictive state. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DEFT achieves a better balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to improved overall performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping Action-Grounded Visual Dynamics in Unified Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06006v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can unified vision-language models (VLMs) perform forward dynamics prediction (FDP), i.e., predicting the future state (in image form) given the previous observation and an action (in language form)? We find that VLMs struggle to generate physically plausible transitions between frames from instructions. Nevertheless, we identify a crucial asymmetry in multimodal grounding: fine-tuning a VLM to learn inverse dynamics prediction (IDP), effectively captioning the action between frames, is significantly easier than learning FDP. In turn, IDP can be used to bootstrap FDP through two main strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference time verification. Firstly, IDP can annotate actions for unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data scale for FDP. Secondly, IDP can assign rewards to multiple samples of FDP to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the FDP resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric image editing on Aurora-Bench with two families of VLMs. Despite remaining general-purpose, our best model achieves a performance competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a margin between $7\%$ and $13\%$ according to GPT4o-as-judge, and achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni-DPO: A Unified Paradigm for Dynamic Preference Optimization of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10054v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based methods typically treat all preference pairs equally, overlooking substantial variations in data quality and learning difficulty, which leads to inefficient data utilization and suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose Uni-DPO, a unified dynamic preference optimization framework that jointly considers (a) the inherent quality of preference pairs and (b) the model's evolving performance during training. By adaptively reweighting samples based on both factors, Uni-DPO enables more effective use of preference data and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of Uni-DPO. On textual tasks, Gemma-2-9B-IT fine-tuned with Uni-DPO surpasses the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by 6.7 points on Arena-Hard. On mathematical and multimodal tasks, Uni-DPO consistently outperforms baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence of its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026.

| **[UniAudio 2.0: A Unified Audio Language Model with Text-Aligned Factorized Audio Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04683v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study two foundational problems in audio language models: (1) how to design an audio tokenizer that can serve as an intermediate representation for both understanding and generation; and (2) how to build an audio foundation model that generalizes in few-shot and zero-shot settings, analogous to large language models. To this end, we make the following two contributions. First, we propose ReasoningCodec, a discrete audio codec that factorizes audio into (i) reasoning tokens, which encode text-aligned, high-level analysis and planning representations for audio understanding and hierarchical generation, and (ii) reconstruction tokens, which encode semantic-rich acoustic cues for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. This design achieves understanding performance comparable to strong continuous representations while improving generation quality and reconstruction fidelity over prior discrete tokenizers. Second, we introduce a unified autoregressive architecture for text and audio, together with multi-stage training and multi-task data construction. Using this framework, we train UniAudio 2.0 on 100B text tokens and 60B audio tokens. Across a wide range of speech, sound, and music tasks, UniAudio 2.0 performs competitively on in-domain evaluations and demonstrates strong few-shot and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks. Demo, code, and checkpoints will be available at \href{https://dongchaoyang.top/UniAudio2Demo/}{https://dongchaoyang.top/UniAudio2Demo/}.</p></details> |  |
| **[CIC-Trap4Phish: A Unified Multi-Format Dataset for Phishing and Quishing Attachment Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09015v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing attacks represents one of the primary attack methods which is used by cyber attackers. In many cases, attackers use deceptive emails along with malicious attachments to trick users into giving away sensitive information or installing malware while compromising entire systems. The flexibility of malicious email attachments makes them stand out as a preferred vector for attackers as they can embed harmful content such as malware or malicious URLs inside standard document formats. Although phishing email defenses have improved a lot, attackers continue to abuse attachments, enabling malicious content to bypass security measures. Moreover, another challenge that researches face in training advance models, is lack of an unified and comprehensive dataset that covers the most prevalent data types. To address this gap, we generated CIC-Trap4Phish, a multi-format dataset containing both malicious and benign samples across five categories commonly used in phishing campaigns: Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, HTML pages, and QR code images. For the first four file types, a set of execution-free static feature pipeline was proposed, designed to capture structural, lexical, and metadata-based indicators without the need to open or execute files. Feature selection was performed using a combination of SHAP analysis and feature importance, yielding compact, discriminative feature subsets for each file type. The selected features were evaluated by using lightweight machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree. All models demonstrate high detection accuracy across formats. For QR code-based phishing (quishing), two complementary methods were implemented: image-based detection by employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and lexical analysis of decoded URLs using recent lightweight language models.</p></details> |  |

Existing automated solutions typically treat each format as an isolated downstream task, leading to redundant processing and semantic inconsistency. We introduce PaperX, a unified framework that models academic presentation generation as a structural transformation and rendering process. Central to our approach is the Scholar DAG, an intermediate representation that decouples the paper's logical structure from its final presentation syntax. By applying adaptive graph traversal strategies, PaperX generates diverse, high quality outputs from a single source. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves the state of the art performance in content fidelity and aesthetic quality while significantly improving cost efficiency compared to specialized single task agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures, Project website: https://github.com/yutao1024/PaperX</p></details> |
| **[EST: Towards Efficient Scaling Laws in Click-Through Rate Prediction via Unified Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10811v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently scaling industrial Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction has recently attracted significant research attention. Existing approaches typically employ early aggregation of user behaviors to maintain efficiency. However, such non-unified or partially unified modeling creates an information bottleneck by discarding fine-grained, token-level signals essential for unlocking scaling gains. In this work, we revisit the fundamental distinctions between CTR prediction and Large Language Models (LLMs), identifying two critical properties: the asymmetry in information density between behavioral and non-behavioral features, and the modality-specific priors of content-rich signals. Accordingly, we propose the Efficiently Scalable Transformer (EST), which achieves fully unified modeling by processing all raw inputs in a single sequence without lossy aggregation. EST integrates two modules: Lightweight Cross-Attention (LCA), which prunes redundant self-interactions to focus on high-impact cross-feature dependencies, and Content Sparse Attention (CSA), which utilizes content similarity to dynamically select high-signal behaviors. Extensive experiments show that EST exhibits a stable and efficient power-law scaling relationship, enabling predictable performance gains with model scale. Deployed on Taobao's display advertising platform, EST significantly outperforms production baselines, delivering a 3.27\% RPM (Revenue Per Mile) increase and a 1.22\% CTR lift, establishing a practical pathway for scalable industrial CTR prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[WorldArena: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Perception and Functional Utility of Embodied World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08971v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While world models have emerged as a cornerstone of embodied intelligence by enabling agents to reason about environmental dynamics through action-conditioned prediction, their evaluation remains fragmented. Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://world-arena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abhis...</summary><p>Abhishek Vijaya Kumar and Bhaskar Kataria have equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[Corruption-Aware Training of Latent Video Diffusion Models for Robust Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21545v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative quality for image and video generation; however, they remain brittle under noisy conditioning, where small perturbations in text or multimodal embeddings can cascade over timesteps and cause semantic drift. Existing corruption strategies from image diffusion (e.g., Gaussian, Uniform) fail in video settings because static noise disrupts temporal fidelity. In this paper, we propose CAT-LVDM, a corruption-aware training framework with structured, data-aligned noise injection tailored for video diffusion. Our two operators, Batch-Centered Noise Injection (BCNI) and Spectrum-Aware Contextual Noise (SACN), align perturbations with batch semantics or spectral dynamics to preserve coherence. CAT-LVDM yields substantial gains: BCNI reduces FVD by 31.9 percent on WebVid-2M, MSR-VTT, and MSVD, while SACN improves UCF-101 by 12.3 percent, outperforming Gaussian, Uniform, and large diffusion baselines such as DEMO (2.3B) and LaVie (3B) despite training on 5x less data. Ablations confirm the unique value of low-rank, data-aligned noise, and theoretical analysis establishes why these operators tighten robustness and generalization bounds. CAT-LVDM thus introduces a principled framework for robust video diffusion and further demonstrates transferability to autoregressive generation and multimodal video understanding models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/chikap421/catlvdm</p></details> |
| **[VideoSTF: Stress-Testing Output Repetition in Video Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10639v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently achieved strong performance in video understanding tasks. However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

| **[Accelerating Streaming Video Large Language Models via Hierarchical Token Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00891v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Streaming Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various video understanding tasks, but they face significant challenges in real-time deployment due to the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens from continuous video streams. In streaming video scenarios, the primary bottleneck lies in the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoding stage, where redundant processing of temporally similar frames leads to inefficiency. Additionally, inflated token sequences during LLM pre-filling further exacerbate latency and memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{S}treaming \textbf{T}oken \textbf{C}ompression (\textbf{STC}), a plug-and-play hierarchical framework that seamlessly integrates into existing streaming VideoLLMs, optimizing both ViT encoding and LLM pre-filling stages to accelerate processing. STC introduces two token-level accelerators: \textbf{STC-Cacher}, which reduces ViT encoding overhead by caching and reusing features from temporally similar frames, and \textbf{STC-Pruner}, which compresses the visual token sequence before it enters the LLM, preserving only the most salient tokens based on both spatial and temporal relevance. Extensive experiments on four baseline streaming VideoLLMs across five benchmarks demonstrate that STC outperforms other compression methods. Notably, STC retains up to \textbf{99\%} of accuracy on the ReKV framework while reducing ViT encoding latency and LLM pre-filling latency by \textbf{24.5\%} and \textbf{45.3\%}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is avaliable at \url{https://github.com/lern-to-write/STC}</p></details> |

Unlike generic activity recognition, collaborative manipulation requires sub-task labels that are directly robot-executable. We present RoboSubtaskNet, a multi-stage human-to-robot sub-task segmentation framework that couples attention-enhanced I3D features (RGB plus optical flow) with a modified MS-TCN employing a Fibonacci dilation schedule to capture better short-horizon transitions such as reach-pick-place. The network is trained with a composite objective comprising cross-entropy and temporal regularizers (truncated MSE and a transition-aware term) to reduce over-segmentation and to encourage valid sub-task progressions. To close the gap between vision benchmarks and control, we introduce RoboSubtask, a dataset of healthcare and industrial demonstrations annotated at the sub-task level and designed for deterministic mapping to manipulator primitives. Empirically, RoboSubtaskNet outperforms MS-TCN and MS-TCN++ on GTEA and our RoboSubtask benchmark (boundary-sensitive and sequence metrics), while remaining competitive on the long-horizon Breakfast benchmark. Specifically, RoboSubtaskNet attains F1 @ 50 = 79.5%, Edit = 88.6%, Acc = 78.9% on GTEA; F1 @ 50 = 30.4%, Edit = 52.0%, Acc = 53.5% on Breakfast; and F1 @ 50 = 94.2%, Edit = 95.6%, Acc = 92.2% on RoboSubtask. We further validate the full perception-to-execution pipeline on a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator, achieving reliable end-to-end behavior in physical trials (overall task success approx 91.25%). These results demonstrate a practical path from sub-task level video understanding to deployed robotic manipulation in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

Yet little is known about how to design and integrate multi-robot videos into public safety workflows. Collaborating with six police agencies, we examined how such videos could be made practical. In Study 1, we presented the first testbed for multi-robot ground video sensemaking. The testbed includes 38 events-of-interest (EoI) relevant to public safety, a dataset of 20 robot patrol videos (10 day/night pairs) covering EoI types, and 6 design requirements aimed at improving current video sensemaking practices. In Study 2, we built MRVS, a tool that augments multi-robot patrol video streams with a prompt-engineered video understanding model. Participants reported reduced manual workload and greater confidence with LLM-based explanations, while noting concerns about false alarms and privacy. We conclude with implications for designing future multi-robot video sensemaking tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[E-VAds: An E-commerce Short Videos Understanding Benchmark for MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08355v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>E-commerce short videos represent a high-revenue segment of the online video industry characterized by a goal-driven format and dense multi-modal signals. Current models often struggle with these videos because existing benchmarks focus primarily on general-purpose tasks and neglect the reasoning of commercial intent. In this work, we first propose a multi-modal information density assessment framework to quantify the complexity of this domain. Our evaluation reveals that e-commerce content exhibits substantially higher density across visual, audio, and textual modalities compared to mainstream datasets, establishing a more challenging frontier for video understanding. To address this gap, we introduce E-commerce Video Ads Benchmark (E-VAds), which is the first benchmark specifically designed for e-commerce short video understanding. We curated 3,961 high-quality videos from Taobao covering a wide range of product categories and used a multi-agent system to generate 19,785 open-ended Q&A pairs. These questions are organized into two primary dimensions, namely Perception and Cognition and Reasoning, which consist of five distinct tasks. Finally, we develop E-VAds-R1, an RL-based reasoning model featuring a multi-grained reward design called MG-GRPO. This strategy provides smooth guidance for early exploration while creating a non-linear incentive for expert-level precision. Experimental results demonstrate that E-VAds-R1 achieves a 109.2% performance gain in commercial intent reasoning with only a few hundred training samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemanticMoments: Training-Free Motion Similarity via Third Moment Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09146v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieving videos based on semantic motion is a fundamental, yet unsolved, problem. Existing video representation approaches overly rely on static appearance and scene context rather than motion dynamics, a bias inherited from their training data and objectives. Conversely, traditional motion-centric inputs like optical flow lack the semantic grounding needed to understand high-level motion. To demonstrate this inherent bias, we introduce the SimMotion benchmarks, combining controlled synthetic data with a new human-annotated real-world dataset. We show that existing models perform poorly on these benchmarks, often failing to disentangle motion from appearance. To address this gap, we propose SemanticMoments, a simple, training-free method that computes temporal statistics (specifically, higher-order moments) over features from pre-trained semantic models. Across our benchmarks, SemanticMoments consistently outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods. This demonstrates that temporal statistics in a semantic feature space provide a scalable and perceptually grounded foundation for motion-centric video understanding.</p></details> |  |

To lay the foundation for this assistant, we conducted a comprehensive data collection study where six participants lived together for one week, continuously recording their daily activities - including discussions, shopping, cooking, socializing, and entertainment - using AI glasses for multimodal egocentric video capture, along with synchronized third-person-view video references. This effort resulted in the EgoLife Dataset, a comprehensive 300-hour egocentric, interpersonal, multiview, and multimodal daily life dataset with intensive annotation. Leveraging this dataset, we introduce EgoLifeQA, a suite of long-context, life-oriented question-answering tasks designed to provide meaningful assistance in daily life by addressing practical questions such as recalling past relevant events, monitoring health habits, and offering personalized recommendations. To address the key technical challenges of (1) developing robust visual-audio models for egocentric data, (2) enabling identity recognition, and (3) facilitating long-context question answering over extensive temporal information, we introduce EgoButler, an integrated system comprising EgoGPT and EgoRAG. EgoGPT is an omni-modal model trained on egocentric datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on egocentric video understanding. EgoRAG is a retrieval-based component that supports answering ultra-long-context questions. Our experimental studies verify their working mechanisms and reveal critical factors and bottlenecks, guiding future improvements. By releasing our datasets, models, and benchmarks, we aim to stimulate further research in egocentric AI assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects the author affiliation to reflect the accurate institutional information at the time of publication.

| **[TiFRe: Text-guided Video Frame Reduction for Efficient Video Multi-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08861v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Video Multi-Modal Large Language Models (Video MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in video-language tasks such as video understanding and question answering. However, Video MLLMs face high computational costs, particularly in processing numerous video frames as input, which leads to significant attention computation overhead. A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames. To preserve video semantics, TiFRe employs a Frame Matching and Merging (FMM) mechanism, which integrates non-key frame information into the selected key frames, minimizing information loss. Experiments show that TiFRe effectively reduces computational costs while improving performance on video-language tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneVision-Encoder: Codec-Aligned Sparsity as a Foundational Principle for Multimodal Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08683v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hypothesis. Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs. Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics. Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data. Notably, on video understanding tasks, OV-Encoder achieves an average improvement of 4.1% over Qwen3-ViT. Codec-aligned, patch-level sparsity is a foundational principle, enabling OV-Encoder as a scalable engine for next-generation visual generalists.</p></details> |  |

However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Existing solutions relying on fixed-size memory or naive compression often suffer from context loss or memory overflow, limiting their effectiveness in long-form, real-time scenarios. We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency. Extensive experiments on StreamingBench demonstrate that Vista achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a strong baseline for real-world streaming video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we present Demo-driven Video In-Context Learning, a novel task focused on learning from in-context demonstrations to answer questions about the target videos. Alongside this, we propose Demo-ICL-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate demo-driven video in-context learning capabilities. Demo-ICL-Bench is constructed from 1200 instructional YouTube videos with associated questions, from which two types of demonstrations are derived: (i) summarizing video subtitles for text demonstration; and (ii) corresponding instructional videos as video demonstrations. To effectively tackle this new challenge, we develop Demo-ICL, an MLLM with a two-stage training strategy: video-supervised fine-tuning and information-assisted direct preference optimization, jointly enhancing the model's ability to learn from in-context examples. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs confirm the difficulty of Demo-ICL-Bench, demonstrate the effectiveness of Demo-ICL, and thereby unveil future research directions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we start by identifying three core tasks in EgoProceAssist: egocentric procedural error detection, egocentric procedural learning, and egocentric procedural question answering, then introduce two enabling dimensions: real-time and streaming video understanding, and proactive interaction in procedural contexts. We define these tasks within a new taxonomy as the EgoProceAssist's essential functions and illustrate how they can be deployed in real-world scenarios for daily activity assistants. Specifically, our work encompasses a comprehensive review of current techniques, relevant datasets, and evaluation metrics across these five core areas. To clarify the gap between the proposed EgoProceAssist and existing VLM-based assistants, we conduct novel experiments to provide a comprehensive evaluation of representative VLM-based methods. Through these findings and our technical analysis, we discuss the challenges ahead and suggest future research directions.

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

We introduce D-ORCA, a \textbf{d}ialogue-centric \textbf{o}mni-modal large language model optimized for \textbf{r}obust audio-visual \textbf{ca}ptioning. We further curate DVD, a large-scale, high-quality bilingual dataset comprising nearly 40,000 multi-party dialogue videos for training and 2000 videos for evaluation in English and Mandarin, addressing a critical gap in the open-source ecosystem. To ensure fine-grained captioning accuracy, we adopt group relative policy optimization with three novel reward functions that assess speaker attribution accuracy, global speech content accuracy, and sentence-level temporal boundary alignment. These rewards are derived from evaluation metrics widely used in speech processing and, to our knowledge, are applied for the first time as reinforcement learning objectives for audio-visual captioning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ORCA substantially outperforms existing open-source models in speaker identification, speech recognition, and temporal grounding. Notably, despite having only 8 billion parameters, D-ORCA achieves performance competitive with Qwen3-Omni across several general-purpose audio-visual understanding benchmarks. Demos are available at \href{https://d-orca-llm.github.io/}{https://d-orca-llm.github.io/}.

To address this, recent agentic thinking-with-videos paradigms have emerged, adopting a localize-clip-answer pipeline in which the model actively identifies relevant video segments, performs dense sampling within those clips, and then produces answers. However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking. Besides, from the data perspective, we develop an effective pipeline to construct high-quality long video grounded QA data, along with a corresponding benchmark for systematic evaluation across various video durations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance on both long video understanding and grounding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process-of-Thought Reasoning for Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07689v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding requires not only recognizing visual content but also performing temporally grounded, multi-step reasoning over long and noisy observations. We propose Process-of-Thought (PoT) Reasoning for Videos, a framework that makes the reasoning process explicit by structuring video inference into a sequence of lightweight, verifiable steps. PoT interleaves (i) temporal evidence selection, (ii) step-wise state updates, and (iii) constrained answer synthesis, enabling the model to progressively refine hypotheses while maintaining traceability to video evidence. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing vision-language backbones, supporting both closed-book reasoning and evidence-augmented reasoning with external tools. We further introduce a unified representation for PoT traces that aligns intermediate decisions with temporal segments, which improves robustness to distractors and reduces hallucinated explanations. Extensive experiments on standard video reasoning tasks demonstrate that PoT consistently improves factual correctness and temporal grounding, while providing interpretable reasoning traces for diagnosis and downstream use.</p></details> |  |

However, despite excelling at general search, existing agents often struggle to bridge the cognitive gap between pixel-level perception and high-level marketing logic. To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy. These results underscore that effective advertising understanding demands explicitly grounding abstract marketing strategies in pixel-level evidence.

Our design leverages a bidirectional state-space model equipped with a gated skip connection and a learnable weighted-average pooling mechanism applied to periodically inserted learned queries. This structure enables hierarchical downsampling across both spatial and temporal dimensions, preserving performance in a cost-effective manner. Across challenging hour-long video understanding tasks, our approach demonstrates competitive results against state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing overall token budget. Notably, replacing our state-space model with conventional modules results in substantial performance degradation, highlighting the advantages of the proposed state-space modeling for effectively compressing multi-frame video information. Our framework emphasizes resource-conscious efficiency, making it practical for real-world deployments.

To address this, we propose CauCLIP, a causality-inspired vision-language framework that leverages CLIP to learn domain-invariant representations for surgical phase recognition without access to target domain data. Our approach integrates a frequency-based augmentation strategy to perturb domain-specific attributes while preserving semantic structures, and a causal suppression loss that mitigates non-causal biases and reinforces causal surgical features. These components are combined in a unified training framework that enables the model to focus on stable causal factors underlying surgical workflows. Experiments on the SurgVisDom hard adaptation benchmark demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms all competing approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of causality-guided vision-language models for domain-generalizable surgical video understanding.</p></details> |  |

We present UniSurg, a video-native foundation model that shifts the learning paradigm from pixel-level reconstruction to latent motion prediction. Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation. These results establish UniSurg as a new standard for universal, motion-oriented surgical video understanding.</p></details> |  |

To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks from the stroke level to the rally level and includes 2527 human-verified questions. Evaluating 17 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Perception Agent for Omnimodal Audio-Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23646v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often face challenges in fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, to our best knowledge, the first fully active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized unimodal tools to achieve more fine-grained omnimodal reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, we demonstrate a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and closed-source models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy without training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website:https://kd-tao.github.io/OmniAgent/</p></details> |

| **[The Observer Effect in World Models: Invasive Adaptation Corrupts Latent Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12218v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining whether neural models internalize physical laws as world models, rather than exploiting statistical shortcuts, remains challenging, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confound what was learned during self-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a non-invasive evaluation protocol, PhyIP. We test whether physical quantities are linearly decodable from frozen representations, motivated by the linear representation hypothesis. Across fluid dynamics and orbital mechanics, we find that when SSL achieves low error, latent structure becomes linearly accessible. PhyIP recovers internal energy and Newtonian inverse-square scaling on OOD tests (e.g., $ρ> 0.90$). In contrast, adaptation-based evaluations can collapse this structure ($ρ\approx 0.05$). These findings suggest that adaptation-based evaluation can obscure latent structures and that low-capacity probes offer a more accurate evaluation of physical world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LDA-1B: Scaling Latent Dynamics Action Model via Universal Embodied Data Ingestion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12215v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent robot foundation models largely rely on large-scale behavior cloning, which imitates expert actions but discards transferable dynamics knowledge embedded in heterogeneous embodied data. While the Unified World Model (UWM) formulation has the potential to leverage such diverse data, existing instantiations struggle to scale to foundation-level due to coarse data usage and fragmented datasets. We introduce LDA-1B, a robot foundation model that scales through universal embodied data ingestion by jointly learning dynamics, policy, and visual forecasting, assigning distinct roles to data of varying quality. To support this regime at scale, we assemble and standardize EI-30k, an embodied interaction dataset comprising over 30k hours of human and robot trajectories in a unified format. Scalable dynamics learning over such heterogeneous data is enabled by prediction in a structured DINO latent space, which avoids redundant pixel-space appearance modeling. Complementing this representation, LDA-1B employs a multi-modal diffusion transformer to handle asynchronous vision and action streams, enabling stable training at the 1B-parameter scale. Experiments in simulation and the real world show LDA-1B outperforms prior methods (e.g., $π_{0.5}$) by up to 21\%, 48\%, and 23\% on contact-rich, dexterous, and long-horizon tasks, respectively. Notably, LDA-1B enables data-efficient fine-tuning, gaining 10\% by leveraging 30\% low-quality trajectories typically harmful and discarded.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page:https://pku-epic.github.io/LDA</p></details> |
| **[GigaBrain-0.5M*: a VLA That Learns From World Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12099v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models that directly predict multi-step action chunks from current observations face inherent limitations due to constrained scene understanding and weak future anticipation capabilities. In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*}, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Built upon \textit{GigaBrain-0.5}, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*} further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via \textit{RAMP} (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that \textit{RAMP} achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\% on challenging tasks including \texttt{Laundry Folding}, \texttt{Box Packing}, and \texttt{Espresso Preparation}. Critically, \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M$^*$} exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our \href{https://gigabrain05m.github.io}{project page}.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain05m.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Neuro-Symbolic Synergy for Interactive World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10480v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose reasoning capabilities, yet they frequently hallucinate when used as world models (WMs), where strict compliance with deterministic transition rules--particularly in corner cases--is essential. In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy. Extensive experiments on three distinct interactive environments, i.e., ScienceWorld, Webshop, and Plancraft, demonstrate NeSyS's consistent advantages over baselines in both WM prediction accuracy and data efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLAW: Iterative Co-Improvement of Vision-Language-Action Policy and World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12063v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of this paper is to improve the performance and reliability of vision-language-action (VLA) models through iterative online interaction. Since collecting policy rollouts in the real world is expensive, we investigate whether a learned simulator-specifically, an action-conditioned video generation model-can be used to generate additional rollout data. Unfortunately, existing world models lack the physical fidelity necessary for policy improvement: they are predominantly trained on demonstration datasets that lack coverage of many different physical interactions (particularly failure cases) and struggle to accurately model small yet critical physical details in contact-rich object manipulation. We propose a simple iterative improvement algorithm that uses real-world roll-out data to improve the fidelity of the world model, which can then, in turn, be used to generate supplemental synthetic data for improving the VLA model. In our experiments on a real robot, we use this approach to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art VLA model on multiple downstream tasks. We achieve a 39.2% absolute success rate improvement over the base policy and 11.6% improvement from training with the generated synthetic rollouts.

| **[Accelerating Robotic Reinforcement Learning with Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11978v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Where Bits Matter in World Model Planning: A Paired Mixed-Bit Study for Efficient Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11882v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient spatial reasoning requires world models that remain reliable under tight precision budgets. We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime. These findings motivate module-aware, budget-aware quantization policies as a broader research direction for efficient spatial reasoning. Code and run artifacts are available at https://github.com/suraj-ranganath/DINO-MBQuant.</p></details> | Workshop submission |
| **[Scaling World Model for Hierarchical Manipulation Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10983v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are promising for generalist robot manipulation but remain brittle in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially with limited real-robot data. To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

| **[HAIC: Humanoid Agile Object Interaction Control via Dynamics-Aware World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11758v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots show promise for complex whole-body tasks in unstructured environments. Although Human-Object Interaction (HOI) has advanced, most methods focus on fully actuated objects rigidly coupled to the robot, ignoring underactuated objects with independent dynamics and non-holonomic constraints. These introduce control challenges from coupling forces and occlusions. We present HAIC, a unified framework for robust interaction across diverse object dynamics without external state estimation. Our key contribution is a dynamics predictor that estimates high-order object states (velocity, acceleration) solely from proprioceptive history. These predictions are projected onto static geometric priors to form a spatially grounded dynamic occupancy map, enabling the policy to infer collision boundaries and contact affordances in blind spots. We use asymmetric fine-tuning, where a world model continuously adapts to the student policy's exploration, ensuring robust state estimation under distribution shifts. Experiments on a humanoid robot show HAIC achieves high success rates in agile tasks (skateboarding, cart pushing/pulling under various loads) by proactively compensating for inertial perturbations, and also masters multi-object long-horizon tasks like carrying a box across varied terrain by predicting the dynamics of multiple objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://haic-humanoid.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Learning Physics-Grounded 4D Dynamics with Neural Gaussian Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00148v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting physical dynamics from raw visual data remains a major challenge in AI. While recent video generation models have achieved impressive visual quality, they still cannot consistently generate physically plausible videos due to a lack of modeling of physical laws. Recent approaches combining 3D Gaussian splatting and physics engines can produce physically plausible videos, but are hindered by high computational costs in both reconstruction and simulation, and often lack robustness in complex real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce Neural Gaussian Force Field (NGFF), an end-to-end neural framework that integrates 3D Gaussian perception with physics-based dynamic modeling to generate interactive, physically realistic 4D videos from multi-view RGB inputs, achieving two orders of magnitude faster than prior Gaussian simulators. To support training, we also present GSCollision, a 4D Gaussian dataset featuring diverse materials, multi-object interactions, and complex scenes, totaling over 640k rendered physical videos (~4 TB). Evaluations on synthetic and real 3D scenarios show NGFF's strong generalization and robustness in physical reasoning, advancing video prediction towards physics-grounded world models.</p></details> | 43 pages, ICLR 2026 |
| **[Budget-Constrained Agentic Large Language Models: Intention-Based Planning for Costly Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11541v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Fidelity Control Variate Approach for Policy Gradient Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05696v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are impractical for training in operational systems or computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations, as they require large amounts of data. Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators, e.g., reduced-order models, heuristic rewards, or learned world models, can cheaply provide useful data, even if they are too coarse for zero-shot transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), a sample-efficient RL framework that mixes scarce target-environment data with a control variate formed from abundant low-fidelity simulation data to construct an unbiased, variance-reduced estimator for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework with a practical, multi-fidelity variant of the classical REINFORCE algorithm. Under standard assumptions, the MFPG estimator guarantees asymptotic convergence to locally optimal policies in the target environment and achieves faster finite-sample convergence than standard REINFORCE. We evaluate MFPG on robotics benchmark tasks with limited high-fidelity data but abundant off-dynamics, low-fidelity data. When low-fidelity data are neutral or beneficial and dynamics gaps are mild-moderate, MFPG is, among the evaluated off-dynamics RL and low-fidelity-only approaches, the only method that consistently achieves statistically significant improvements over a high-fidelity-only baseline. When low-fidelity data become harmful, MFPG exhibits the strongest robustness, whereas strong off-dynamics RL methods exploit low-fidelity data aggressively and fail much more severely. An additional experiment with anti-correlated high- and low-fidelity rewards shows MFPG can remain effective even under reward misspecification. MFPG thus offers a reliable paradigm for exploiting cheap low-fidelity data (e.g., for efficient sim-to-real transfer) while managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-JEPA: Learning World Models through Object-Level Latent Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11389v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

| **[H-WM: Robotic Task and Motion Planning Guided by Hierarchical World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11291v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models are becoming central to robotic planning and control, as they enable prediction of future state transitions. Existing approaches often emphasize video generation or natural language prediction, which are difficult to directly ground in robot actions and suffer from compounding errors over long horizons. Traditional task and motion planning relies on symbolic logic world models, such as planning domains, that are robot-executable and robust for long-horizon reasoning. However, these methods typically operate independently of visual perception, preventing synchronized symbolic and perceptual state prediction. We propose a Hierarchical World Model (H-WM) that jointly predicts logical and visual state transitions within a unified bilevel framework. H-WM combines a high-level logical world model with a low-level visual world model, integrating the robot-executable, long-horizon robustness of symbolic reasoning with perceptual grounding from visual observations. The hierarchical outputs provide stable and consistent intermediate guidance for long-horizon tasks, mitigating error accumulation and enabling robust execution across extended task sequences. To train H-WM, we introduce a robotic dataset that aligns robot motion with symbolic states, actions, and visual observations. Experiments across vision-language-action (VLA) control policies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce MIND, the first open-domain closed-loop revisited benchmark for evaluating Memory consIstency and action coNtrol in worlD models. MIND contains 250 high-quality videos at 1080p and 24 FPS, including 100 (first-person) + 100 (third-person) video clips under a shared action space and 25 + 25 clips across varied action spaces covering eight diverse scenes. We design an efficient evaluation framework to measure two core abilities: memory consistency and action control, capturing temporal stability and contextual coherence across viewpoints. Furthermore, we design various action spaces, including different character movement speeds and camera rotation angles, to evaluate the action generalization capability across different action spaces under shared scenes. To facilitate future performance benchmarking on MIND, we introduce MIND-World, a novel interactive Video-to-World baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the completeness of MIND and reveal key challenges in current world models, including the difficulty of maintaining long-term memory consistency and generalizing across action spaces.

| **[Agent World Model: Infinity Synthetic Environments for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10090v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

| **[RISE: Self-Improving Robot Policy with Compositional World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11075v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the sustained scaling on model capacity and data acquisition, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models remain brittle in contact-rich and dynamic manipulation tasks, where minor execution deviations can compound into failures. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/kai0-rl/</p></details> |

| **[ResWorld: Temporal Residual World Model for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10884v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The comprehensive understanding capabilities of world models for driving scenarios have significantly improved the planning accuracy of end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks. However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance. The code is available at https://github.com/mengtan00/ResWorld.git.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

When such models rely on complex simulators, evaluating the likelihood is typically intractable, making traditional inference methods such as MCMC inapplicable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) addresses this by training deep generative models to approximate the posterior distribution over parameters using simulated data. In this work, we consider the tall data setting, where multiple independent observations provide additional information, allowing sharper posteriors and improved parameter identifiability. Building on the flourishing score-based diffusion literature, F-NPSE (Geffner et al., 2023) estimates the tall data posterior by composing individual scores from a neural network trained only for a single context observation. This enables more flexible and simulation-efficient inference than alternative approaches for tall datasets in SBI. However, it relies on costly Langevin dynamics during sampling. We propose a new algorithm that eliminates the need for Langevin steps by explicitly approximating the diffusion process of the tall data posterior. Our method retains the advantages of compositional score-based inference while being significantly faster and more stable than F-NPSE. We demonstrate its improved performance on toy problems and standard SBI benchmarks, and showcase its scalability by applying it to a complex real-world model from computational neuroscience.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 24 figures, 3 tables, 2 algorithms, 12 appendices, TMLR acceptance</p></details> |
| **[WorldArena: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Perception and Functional Utility of Embodied World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08971v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While world models have emerged as a cornerstone of embodied intelligence by enabling agents to reason about environmental dynamics through action-conditioned prediction, their evaluation remains fragmented. Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability. WorldArena benchmark with the public leaderboard is released at https://world-arena.ai, providing a framework for tracking progress toward truly functional world models in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Say, Dream, and Act: Learning Video World Models for Instruction-Driven Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10717v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation requires anticipating how the environment evolves in response to actions, yet most existing systems lack this predictive capability, often resulting in errors and inefficiency. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide high-level guidance, they cannot explicitly forecast future states, and existing world models either predict only short horizons or produce spatially inconsistent frames. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines. Codes & Models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[AUDETER: A Large-scale Dataset for Deepfake Audio Detection in Open Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04345v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech synthesis systems can now produce highly realistic vocalisations that pose significant authenticity challenges. Despite substantial progress in deepfake detection models, their real-world effectiveness is often undermined by evolving distribution shifts between training and test data, driven by the complexity of human speech and the rapid evolution of synthesis systems. Existing datasets suffer from limited real speech diversity, insufficient coverage of recent synthesis systems, and heterogeneous mixtures of deepfake sources, which hinder systematic evaluation and open-world model training. To address these issues, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale and highly diverse deepfake audio dataset comprising over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10 vocoders, totalling 3 million clips. We further observe that most existing detectors default to binary supervised training, which can induce negative transfer across synthesis sources when the training data contains highly diverse deepfake patterns, impacting overall generalisation. As a complementary contribution, we propose an effective curriculum-learning-based approach to mitigate this effect. Extensive experiments show that existing detection models struggle to generalise to novel deepfakes and human speech in AUDETER, whereas XLR-based detectors trained on AUDETER achieve strong cross-domain performance across multiple benchmarks, achieving an EER of 1.87% on In-the-Wild. AUDETER is available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

While pre-trained large models have been hypothesized to contain similar knowledge due to extensive pre-training on vast amounts of internet scale data, using them directly in a search procedure is inefficient and inaccurate. Conversely, partial models focus on making high quality predictions for a subset of state and actions: those linked through affordances that achieve user intents~\citep{khetarpal2020can}. Can we posit large models as partial world models? We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. In the multi-task setting, we introduce distribution-robust affordances and show that partial models can be extracted to significantly improve search efficiency. Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that our affordance-aware partial models reduce the search branching factor and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable. For reliable and useful enterprise agents, WoW motivates a new paradigm to explicitly learn system dynamics. We release our GitHub for setting up and evaluating WoW.</p></details> |  |

Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.</p></details> |  |

It decouples understanding and generation via task-specific low-rank adapters, avoiding objective interference and representation entanglement, while a novel reference-based multimodal preference alignment optimizes relative outcomes under identical conditioning, improving faithfulness and controllability without large-scale retraining. UniDFlpw achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to tasks including inpainting, in-context image generation, reference-based editing, and compositional generation, despite no explicit task-specific training.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepGen 1.0: A Lightweight Unified Multimodal Model for Advancing Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12205v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Reasoning Benchmark: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Classroom-Authentic Visual Problems from Primary Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12196v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI models have achieved state-of-the-art results in textual reasoning; however, their ability to reason over spatial and relational structures remains a critical bottleneck -- particularly in early-grade maths, which relies heavily on visuals. This paper introduces the visual reasoning benchmark (VRB), a novel dataset designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to solve authentic visual problems from classrooms. This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions. Consequently, education-focused benchmarks like the VRB are essential for determining the functional boundaries of multimodal tools used in classrooms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry of Uncertainty: Learning Metric Spaces for Multimodal State Estimation in RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12087v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the state of an environment from high-dimensional, multimodal, and noisy observations is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic models to account for the uncertainty, but often require explicit noise assumptions, in turn limiting generalization. In this work, we contribute a novel method to learn a structured latent representation, in which distances between states directly correlate with the minimum number of actions required to transition between them. The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show enhanced performance of an RL agent via the learned representation, eliminating the need of explicit noise augmentation. The presented results suggest that leveraging transition-aware metric spaces provides a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight and parameter-efficient foundation model with plug-and-play integration of fMRI time series and diffusion-derived structural connectivity, allowing unimodal or multimodal training and deployment without architectural changes while requiring substantially less data compared to the state-of-the-art. The model processes fMRI time series through parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams, distilled into compact embeddings by a Perceiver module, while a novel signed graph transformer encodes anatomical connectivity from diffusion MRI. These complementary representations are then combined through an adaptive fusion mechanism. Despite its compact design, BrainSymphony consistently outperforms larger models on benchmarks spanning prediction, classification, and unsupervised network discovery. Highlighting the model's generalizability and interpretability, attention maps reveal drug-induced context-dependent reorganization of cortical hierarchies in an independent psilocybin neuroimaging dataset. BrainSymphony delivers accessible, interpretable, and clinically meaningful results and demonstrates that architecturally informed, multimodal models can surpass much larger counterparts and advance applications of AI in neuroscience.</p></details> | 32 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Zooming without Zooming: Region-to-Image Distillation for Fine-Grained Multimodal Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11858v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass. Our code is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/Zooming-without-Zooming.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLDocRAG: Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10271v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding multimodal long-context documents that comprise multimodal chunks such as paragraphs, figures, and tables is challenging due to (1) cross-modal heterogeneity to localize relevant information across modalities, (2) cross-page reasoning to aggregate dispersed evidence across pages. To address these challenges, we are motivated to adopt a query-centric formulation that projects cross-modal and cross-page information into a unified query representation space, with queries acting as abstract semantic surrogates for heterogeneous multimodal content. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation (MLDocRAG) framework that leverages a Multimodal Chunk-Query Graph (MCQG) to organize multimodal document content around semantically rich, answerable queries. MCQG is constructed via a multimodal document expansion process that generates fine-grained queries from heterogeneous document chunks and links them to their corresponding content across modalities and pages. This graph-based structure enables selective, query-centric retrieval and structured evidence aggregation, thereby enhancing grounding and coherence in multimodal long-context question answering. Experiments on datasets MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL demonstrate that MLDocRAG consistently improves retrieval quality and answer accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for multimodal long-context understanding.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass. Empirically, our method demonstrates consistent gains on two popular object hallucination benchmarks across two MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScalSelect: Scalable Training-Free Multimodal Data Selection for Efficient Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11636v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

A core challenge is to build a scalable long-horizon memory that supports an agentic workflow for planning, retrieval, and reasoning over open-ended instructions at variable granularity, while producing precise, actionable answers for navigation. We present STaR, an agentic reasoning framework that (i) constructs a task-agnostic, multimodal long-term memory that generalizes to unseen queries while preserving fine-grained environmental semantics (object attributes, spatial relations, and dynamic events), and (ii) introduces a Scalable Task Conditioned Retrieval algorithm based on the Information Bottleneck principle to extract from long-term memory a compact, non-redundant, information-rich set of candidate memories for contextual reasoning. We evaluate STaR on NaVQA (mixed indoor/outdoor campus scenes) and WH-VQA, a customized warehouse benchmark with many visually similar objects built with Isaac Sim, emphasizing contextual reasoning. Across the two datasets, STaR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher success rates and markedly lower spatial error. We further deploy STaR on a real Husky wheeled robot in both indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating robust long horizon reasoning, scalability, and practical utility.

However, such adaptation often leads to a degradation in generalization on pretrained tasks, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting. Existing methods that aim to mitigate this issue either become ineffective when fine-tuning deeper layers of the language decoder or scale poorly with increasing model size. To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Fact-Level Attribution for Verifiable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11509v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for real-world tasks involving multi-step reasoning and long-form generation, where reliability requires grounding model outputs in heterogeneous input sources and verifying individual factual claims. However, existing multimodal grounding benchmarks and evaluation methods focus on simplified, observation-based scenarios or limited modalities and fail to assess attribution in complex multimodal reasoning. We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments. Benchmarking with human and automated scores reveals that even strong MLLMs frequently hallucinate citations despite correct reasoning. Moreover, we observe a key trade-off: increasing reasoning depth or enforcing structured grounding often degrades accuracy, highlighting a significant gap between internal reasoning and verifiable attribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages.

Cameras provide dense visual cues but ill posed depth; LiDAR provides a precise 3D structure but sparse coverage. Existing BEV-based fusion frameworks have made good progress, but they have difficulties including inefficient context modeling, spatially invariant fusion, and reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce MambaFusion, a unified multi-modal detection framework that achieves efficient, adaptive, and physically grounded 3D perception. MambaFusion interleaves selective state-space models (SSMs) with windowed transformers to propagate the global context in linear time while preserving local geometric fidelity. A multi-modal token alignment (MTA) module and reliability-aware fusion gates dynamically re-weight camera-LiDAR features based on spatial confidence and calibration consistency. Finally, a structure-conditioned diffusion head integrates graph-based reasoning with uncertainty-aware denoising, enforcing physical plausibility, and calibrated confidence. MambaFusion establishes new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmarks while operating with linear-time complexity. The framework demonstrates that coupling SSM-based efficiency with reliability-driven fusion yields robust, temporally stable, and interpretable 3D perception for real-world autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Main Track)</p></details> |

In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered "agent", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

We leverage the reasoning capabilities of a frozen, pretrained large language model (LLM) to infer fine-grained local implicit rewards by decomposing global, session-level feedback. Our first \emph{text-only} variant prompts the LLM to perform reward decomposition using only the dialogue transcript. The second \emph{multimodal} variant incorporates additional behavioral cues, such as pitch, gaze, and facial affect, expressed as natural language descriptions. These inferred turn-level rewards are distilled into a lightweight reward model, which we utilize for RL-based fine-tuning for dialogue generation. We evaluate both text-only and multimodal variants against state-of-the-art reward decomposition methods and demonstrate notable improvements in human evaluations of conversation quality, suggesting that LLMs are strong reward decomposers that obviate the need for manual reward shaping and granular human feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Meanwhile, advances in mixed reality (MR) hardware have enabled applications that extend beyond entertainment and into everyday use. However, most existing MR systems rely primarily on manual input (e.g., hand gestures or controllers) and provide limited intelligent assistance due to the lack of integration with large-scale AI models. We present Reality Copilot, a voice-first human-AI assistant for mixed reality that leverages LMMs to enable natural speech-based interaction. The system supports contextual understanding of physical environments, realistic 3D content generation, and real-time information retrieval. In addition to in-headset interaction, Reality Copilot facilitates cross-platform workflows by generating context-aware textual content and exporting generated assets. This work explores the design space of LMM-powered human-AI collaboration in mixed reality.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ScratchWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents on program-by-construction tasks in Scratch. Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art multimodal language models and GUI agents reveal a substantial reasoning--acting gap, highlighting persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong planning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG). Code and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

| **[Visual Reasoning Benchmark: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Classroom-Authentic Visual Problems from Primary Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12196v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI models have achieved state-of-the-art results in textual reasoning; however, their ability to reason over spatial and relational structures remains a critical bottleneck -- particularly in early-grade maths, which relies heavily on visuals. This paper introduces the visual reasoning benchmark (VRB), a novel dataset designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to solve authentic visual problems from classrooms. This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions. Consequently, education-focused benchmarks like the VRB are essential for determining the functional boundaries of multimodal tools used in classrooms.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies show that safety behaviors are concentrated in a small subset of parameters, making alignment brittle and easily bypassed through neuron-level attacks. Moreover, most existing alignment methods operate at the behavioral level, offering limited control over the model's internal safety mechanisms. In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations. Extensive experiments across models and modalities demonstrate that SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities. Furthermore, our layer-wise analysis reveals that safety behaviors are governed by stable and shared internal representations. Overall, SafeNeuron provides an interpretable and robust perspective for model alignment.</p></details> |  |

To address the above challenges, this paper presents EasyUUV, a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced, universal, and lightweight simulation-to-reality reinforcement learning (RL) framework for robust attitude control of UUVs. EasyUUV combines parallelized RL training with a hybrid control architecture, where a learned policy outputs high-level attitude corrections executed by an adaptive S-Surface controller. A multimodal LLM is further integrated to adaptively tune controller parameters at runtime using visual and textual feedback, enabling training-free adaptation to unmodeled dynamics. Also, we have developed a low-cost 6-DoF UUV platform and applied an RL policy trained through efficient parallelized simulation. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and outstanding performance of EasyUUV in achieving robust and adaptive UUV attitude control across diverse underwater conditions. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, the source code, LLM prompts, and supplementary video are provided in the following repositories: Homepage: https://360zmem.github.io/easyuuv/ Video:https://youtu.be/m2yLQzxiIL</p></details> | 10 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Human Behavior Atlas: Benchmarking Unified Psychological and Social Behavior Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04899v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using intelligent systems to perceive psychological and social behaviors, that is, the underlying affective, cognitive, and pathological states that are manifested through observable behaviors and social interactions, remains a challenge due to their complex, multifaceted, and personalized nature. Existing work tackling these dimensions through specialized datasets and single-task systems often miss opportunities for scalability, cross-task transfer, and broader generalization. To address this gap, we curate Human Behavior Atlas, a unified benchmark of diverse behavioral tasks designed to support the development of foundation models for understanding psychological and social behaviors. Human Behavior Atlas comprises over 100,000 samples spanning text, audio, and visual modalities, covering tasks on affective states, cognitive states, pathologies, and social processes. Our unification efforts can reduce redundancy and cost, enable training to scale efficiently across tasks, and enhance generalization of behavioral features across domains. On Human Behavior Atlas, we train three models: Omnisapiens-7B SFT, Omnisapiens-7B BAM, and Omnisapiens-7B RL. We show that training on Human Behavior Atlas enables models to consistently outperform existing multimodal LLMs across diverse behavioral tasks. Pretraining on Human Behavior Atlas also improves transfer to novel behavioral datasets; with the targeted use of behavioral descriptors yielding meaningful performance gains. The benchmark, models, and codes can be found at: https://github.com/MIT-MI/human_behavior_atlas.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Bi-Level Prompt Optimization for Multimodal LLM-as-a-Judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11340v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[TableDART: Dynamic Adaptive Multi-Modal Routing for Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14671v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling semantic and structural information from tabular data remains a core challenge for effective table understanding. Existing Table-as-Text approaches flatten tables for large language models (LLMs), but lose crucial structural cues, while Table-as-Image methods preserve structure yet struggle with precise semantics. Recent Table-as-Multimodality strategies attempt to combine textual and visual views, but they (1) statically process both modalities for every query-table pair within large multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), inevitably introducing redundancy and even conflicts, and (2) depend on costly fine-tuning of MLLMs. In light of this, we propose TableDART, a training-efficient framework that integrates multimodal views by reusing pretrained single-modality models. TableDART introduces a lightweight 2.59M-parameter MLP gating network that dynamically selects the optimal path (Text-only, Image-only, or Fusion) for each table-query pair, reducing redundancy and avoiding conflicts that arise when textual and visual views of the same table provide inconsistent cues. By routing to the most appropriate view, our framework improves both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we propose a novel agent to mediate cross-modal knowledge integration by analyzing outputs from text- and image-based models, either selecting the best result or synthesizing a new answer through reasoning. This design avoids the prohibitive costs of full MLLM fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks show that TableDART establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, surpassing the strongest baseline by an average of 4.02%. The code is available at: https://github.com/xiaobo-xing/TableDART.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026. 26 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Speech-Audio Compositional Attacks on Multimodal LLMs and Their Mitigation with SALMONN-Guard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10222v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in LLMs has enabled understanding of audio signals, but has also exposed new safety risks arising from complex audio inputs that are inadequately handled by current safeguards. We introduce SACRED-Bench (Speech-Audio Composition for RED-teaming) to evaluate the robustness of LLMs under complex audio-based attacks. Unlike existing perturbation-based methods that rely on noise optimization or white-box access, SACRED-Bench exploits speech-audio composition to enable effective black-box attacks. SACRED-Bench adopts three composition mechanisms: (a) overlap of harmful and benign speech, (b) mixture of benign speech with harmful non-speech audio, and (c) multi-speaker dialogue. These mechanisms focus on evaluating safety in settings where benign and harmful intents co-occur within a single auditory scene. Moreover, questions in SACRED-Bench are designed to implicitly refer to content in the audio, such that no explicit harmful information appears in the text prompt alone. Experiments demonstrate that even Gemini 2.5 Pro, a state-of-the-art proprietary LLM with safety guardrails fully enabled, still exhibits a 66% attack success rate. To bridge this gap, we propose SALMONN-Guard, the first guard model that jointly inspects speech, audio, and text for safety judgments, reducing the attack success rate to 20%. Our results highlight the need for audio-aware defenses to ensure the safety of multimodal LLMs. The dataset and SALMONN-Guard checkpoints can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/SACRED-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Transcripts: A Renewed Perspective on Audio Chaptering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08979v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio chaptering, the task of automatically segmenting long-form audio into coherent sections, is increasingly important for navigating podcasts, lectures, and videos. Despite its relevance, research remains limited and text-based, leaving key questions unresolved about leveraging audio information, handling ASR errors, and transcript-free evaluation. We address these gaps through three contributions: (1) a systematic comparison between text-based models with acoustic features, a novel audio-only architecture (AudioSeg) operating on learned audio representations, and multimodal LLMs; (2) empirical analysis of factors affecting performance, including transcript quality, acoustic features, duration, and speaker composition; and (3) formalized evaluation protocols contrasting transcript-dependent text-space protocols with transcript-invariant time-space protocols. Our experiments on YTSeg reveal that AudioSeg substantially outperforms text-based approaches, pauses provide the largest acoustic gains, and MLLMs remain limited by context length and weak instruction following, yet MLLMs are promising on shorter audio.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnomSeer: Reinforcing Multimodal LLMs to Reason for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08868v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is an emerging area, yet a persistent challenge remains: MLLMs rely on coarse time-series heuristics but struggle with multi-dimensional, detailed reasoning, which is vital for understanding complex time-series data. We present AnomSeer to address this by reinforcing the model to ground its reasoning in precise, structural details of time series, unifying anomaly classification, localization, and explanation. At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms). Building on this, we propose a novel time-series grounded policy optimization (TimerPO) that incorporates two additional components beyond standard reinforcement learning: a time-series grounded advantage based on optimal transport and an orthogonal projection to ensure this auxiliary granular signal does not interfere with the primary detection objective. Across diverse anomaly scenarios, AnomSeer, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B-Instruct, outperforms larger commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o) in classification and localization accuracy, particularly on point- and frequency-driven exceptions. Moreover, it produces plausible time-series reasoning traces that support its conclusions.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do MLLMs Really See It: Reinforcing Visual Attention in Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08241v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has substantially improved multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, existing approaches largely rely on long textual reasoning trajectories and provide limited mechanisms for learning stable visual attention policies. Our analysis shows that current MLLMs exhibit weak visual focus: early-stage visual misalignment is rarely corrected during subsequent reasoning, leading to error propagation and failed inferences. We argue that this limitation stems from inadequate credit assignment for visual attention during training. To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward. This reward explicitly aligns optimization signals with visually grounded reasoning steps, enabling the model to learn more reliable attention behaviors. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SAYO consistently improves performance on diverse reasoning and perception tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCIE: Multimodal LLM-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing with Spatial Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07993v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in instruction-based image editing have shown remarkable progress. However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions. In this work, we address these limitations from the perspectives of architectural design, data, and evaluation protocols. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics. Experimental results on CIE-Bench demonstrate that MCIE-E1 consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, achieving a 23.96% improvement in instruction compliance.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2026 |
| **[Task-Conditioned Probing Reveals Brain-Alignment Patterns in Instruction-Tuned Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08277v2)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain alignment compared to unimodal models. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal (IT) models have been shown to generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity, yet most prior evaluations focus on unimodal stimuli or non-instruction-tuned models under multimodal stimuli. We still lack a clear understanding of whether instruction-tuning is associated with IT-MLLMs organizing their representations around functional task demands or if they simply reflect surface semantics. To address this, we estimate brain alignment by predicting fMRI responses recorded during naturalistic movie watching (video with audio) from MLLM representations. Using instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio IT-MLLMs, across 13 video task instructions, we find that instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform in-context learning (ICL) multimodal models (~9%), non-instruction-tuned multimodal models (~15%), and unimodal baselines (~20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs across video and audio tasks, and language-guided probing produces distinct task-specific MLLM representations that vary across brain regions. We also find that ICL models show strong semantic organization (r=0.78), while IT models show weak coupling to instruction-text semantics (r=0.14), consistent with task-conditioned subspaces associated with higher brain alignment. These findings are consistent with an association between task-specific instructions and stronger brain-MLLM alignment, and open new avenues for mapping joint information processing in both systems. We make the code publicly available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].</p></details> | 55 pages, 35 figures |
| **[ViCA: Efficient Multimodal LLMs with Vision-Only Cross-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07574v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) adopt a unified self-attention design that processes visual and textual tokens at every Transformer layer, incurring substantial computational overhead. In this work, we revisit the necessity of such dense visual processing and show that projected visual embeddings are already well-aligned with the language space, while effective vision-language interaction occurs in only a small subset of layers. Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/ViCA.</p></details> |  |

However, designing such feedback at scale for all objects within a VR scene remains time-consuming. We present Scene2Hap, an LLM-centered system that automatically designs object-level vibrotactile feedback for entire VR scenes based on the objects' semantic attributes and physical context. Scene2Hap employs a multimodal large language model to estimate each object's semantics and physical context, including its material properties and vibration behavior, from multimodal information in the VR scene. These estimated attributes are then used to generate or retrieve audio signals, subsequently converted into plausible vibrotactile signals. For more realistic spatial haptic rendering, Scene2Hap estimates vibration propagation and attenuation from vibration sources to neighboring objects, considering the estimated material properties and spatial relationships of virtual objects in the scene. Three user studies confirm that Scene2Hap successfully estimates the vibration-related semantics and physical context of VR scenes and produces realistic vibrotactile signals.</p></details> | Accepted at CHI 2026 |

Yet current AD production tools remain largely inaccessible to BLV video creators, who possess valuable expertise but face barriers due to visually-driven interfaces. We present ADCanvas, a multimodal authoring system that supports non-visual control over audio description (AD) creation. ADCanvas combines conversational interaction with keyboard-based playback control and a plain-text, screen reader-accessible editor to support end-to-end AD authoring and visual question answering (VQA). Combining screen-reader-friendly controls with a multimodal LLM agent, ADCanvas supports live VQA, script generation, and AD modification. Through a user study with 12 BLV video creators, we find that users adopt the conversational agent as an informational aide and drafting assistant, while maintaining agency through verification and editing. For example, participants saw themselves as curators who received information from the model and filtered it down for their audience. Our findings offer design implications for accessible media tools, including precise editing controls, accessibility support for creative ideation, and configurable rules for human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, published in CHI '26</p></details> |

We find that while cross-modal consensus often mitigates conventional poisoning that manipulates interaction logs or perturbs a single modality, it also introduces a new attack surface where synchronised multimodal poisoning can reliably steer fused representations along stable semantic directions during fine-tuning. To characterise this threat, we formalise cross-modal interactive poisoning and propose VENOMREC, which performs Exposure Alignment to identify high-exposure regions in the joint embedding space and Cross-modal Interactive Perturbation to craft attention-guided coupled token-patch edits. Experiments on three real-world multimodal datasets demonstrate that VENOMREC consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.73 mean ER@20 and improving over the strongest baseline by +0.52 absolute ER points on average, while maintaining comparable recommendation utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personagram: Bridging Personas and Product Design for Creative Ideation with Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06197v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Product designers often begin their design process with handcrafted personas. While personas are intended to ground design decisions in consumer preferences, they often fall short in practice by remaining abstract, expensive to produce, and difficult to translate into actionable design features. As a result, personas risk serving as static reference points rather than tools that actively shape design outcomes. To address these challenges, we built Personagram, an interactive system powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that helps designers explore detailed census-based personas, extract product features inferred from persona attributes, and recombine them for specific customer segments. In a study with 12 professional designers, we show that Personagram facilitates more actionable ideation workflows by structuring multimodal thinking from persona attributes to product design features, achieving higher engagement with personas, perceived transparency, and satisfaction compared to a chat-based baseline. We discuss implications of integrating AI-generated personas into product design workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought powerful generative and reasoning capabilities, significantly enhancing SR performance, while Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) further extend this by introducing data like images and interactive relationships. However, critical issues remain, i.e., (a) Suboptimal item representations caused by lengthy and redundant descriptions, leading to inefficiencies in both training and inference; (b) Modality-related cognitive bias, as LLMs are predominantly pretrained on textual data, limiting their ability to effectively integrate and utilize non-textual modalities; (c) Weakening sequential perception in long interaction sequences, where attention mechanisms struggle to capture earlier interactions, hindering the modeling of long-range dependencies. To address these issues, we propose Speeder, an efficient MLLM-based paradigm for SR featuring three key innovations: 1) Multimodal Representation Compression (MRC), which condenses item attributes into concise yet informative tokens, reducing redundancy and computational cost; 2) Modality-aware Progressive Optimization (MPO), enabling gradual learning of multimodal representations; 3) Sequential Position Awareness Enhancement (SPAE), improving the LLM's capability to capture both relative and absolute sequential dependencies in long interaction sequences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Speeder. Speeder increases training speed to 250% of the original while reducing inference time to 25% on the Amazon dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clouding the Mirror: Stealthy Prompt Injection Attacks Targeting LLM-based Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05484v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing sites continue to grow in volume and sophistication. Recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze URLs, HTML, and rendered content to decide whether a website is a phishing site. While these approaches are promising, LLMs are inherently vulnerable to prompt injection (PI). Because attackers can fully control various elements of phishing sites, this creates the potential for PI that exploits the perceptual asymmetry between LLMs and humans: instructions imperceptible to end users can still be parsed by the LLM and can stealthily manipulate its judgment. The specific risks of PI in phishing detection and effective mitigation strategies remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of PI against multimodal LLM-based phishing detection. We introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy, defined by Attack Techniques and Attack Surfaces, that captures realistic PI strategies. Using this taxonomy, we implement diverse attacks and empirically study several representative LLM-based detection systems. The results show that phishing detection with state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 remains vulnerable to PI. We then propose InjectDefuser, a defense framework that combines prompt hardening, allowlist-based retrieval augmentation, and output validation. Across multiple models, InjectDefuser significantly reduces attack success rates. Our findings clarify the PI risk landscape and offer practical defenses that improve the reliability of next-generation phishing countermeasures.</p></details> |  |

However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Attention Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04884v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training with Reinforcement Learning (RL) has substantially improved reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling. However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance. We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.</p></details> |  |

The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs. Our Benchmark's anonymous repository is at https://github.com/EtaYang10th/Open-M3-Bench</p></details> |  |
| **[Alignment Drift in Multimodal LLMs: A Two-Phase, Longitudinal Evaluation of Harm Across Eight Model Releases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04739v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, yet their safety under adversarial prompting remains underexplored. We present a two-phase evaluation of MLLM harmlessness using a fixed benchmark of 726 adversarial prompts authored by 26 professional red teamers. Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour.</p></details> | under peer-review |
| **[Agentic Explainable Artificial Intelligence (Agentic XAI) Approach To Explore Better Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21066v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) enables data-driven understanding of factor associations with response variables, yet communicating XAI outputs to laypersons remains challenging, hindering trust in AI-based predictions. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, they usually fail to produce satisfactory outputs that are aligned to users' authentic demands and preferences. In this work, we introduce Dual-Iterative Optimization (Dual-IPO), an iterative paradigm that sequentially optimizes both the reward model and the video generation model for improved synthesis quality and human preference alignment. For the reward model, our framework ensures reliable and robust reward signals via CoT-guided reasoning, voting-based self-consistency, and preference certainty estimation. Given this, we optimize video foundation models with guidance of signals from reward model's feedback, thus improving the synthesis quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. The reward model and video generation model complement each other and are progressively improved in the multi-round iteration, without requiring tediously manual preference annotations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Dual-IPO can effectively and consistently improve the video generation quality of base model with various architectures and sizes, even help a model with only 2B parameters surpass a 5B one. Moreover, our analysis experiments and ablation studies identify the rational of our systematic design and the efficacy of each component.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, their performance on video remains inferior to Video Foundation Models (VFMs). In this paper, we focus on leveraging MLLMs for video-text embedding and retrieval. We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce a lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related video-text embedding learning without visual supervision. Remarkably, without any fine-tuning beyond text, our method outperforms current methods, often by a substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art results across common video retrieval benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://iyttor.github.io/VidVec/</p></details> |
| **[Simulating the Visual World with Artificial Intelligence: A Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08585v4)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems. An up-to-date list of related works is maintained at this link.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://world-model-roadmap.github.io/ Github Repo: https://github.com/ziqihuangg/Awesome-From-Video-Generation-to-World-Model</p></details> |

We hypothesize that explicitly disentangling shared and modality-specific representations within multimodal foundation model embeddings can enhance clinical interpretability and generalization. To validate this hypothesis, we propose DIVINE a fully disentangled multimodal framework that operates on representations extracted from state-of-the-art (SOTA) audio and video foundation models, incorporating hierarchical variational bottlenecks, sparse gated fusion, and learnable symptom tokens. DIVINE operates in a multitask learning setup to jointly predict diagnostic categories (Healthy Control,ALS, Stroke) and severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe). The model is trained using synchronized audio and video inputs and evaluated on the Toronto NeuroFace dataset under full (audio-video) as well as single-modality (audio-only and video-only) test conditions. Our proposed approach, DIVINE achieves SOTA result, with the DeepSeek-VL2 and TRILLsson combination reaching 98.26% accuracy and 97.51% F1-score. Under modality-constrained scenarios, the framework performs well, showing strong generalization when tested with video-only or audio-only inputs. It consistently yields superior performance compared to unimodal models and baseline fusion techniques. To the best of our knowledge, DIVINE is the first framework that combines cross-modal disentanglement, adaptive fusion, and multitask learning to comprehensively assess neurological disorders using synchronized speech and facial video.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EACL 2026</p></details> |
| **[Wow, wo, val! A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04137v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGOnline: Segment Any Gaussians Online](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08219v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit 3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation remains challenging. Existing segmentation approaches typically rely on high-dimensional feature lifting, which causes costly optimization, implicit semantics, and task-specific constraints. We present \textbf{Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline)}, a unified, zero-shot framework that achieves real-time, cross-view consistent segmentation without scene-specific training. SAGOnline decouples the monolithic segmentation problem into lightweight sub-tasks. By integrating video foundation models (e.g., SAM 2), we first generate temporally consistent 2D masks across rendered views. Crucially, instead of learning continuous feature fields, we introduce a \textbf{Rasterization-aware Geometric Consensus} mechanism that leverages the traceability of the Gaussian rasterization pipeline. This allows us to deterministically map 2D predictions to explicit, discrete 3D primitive labels in real-time. This discrete representation eliminates the memory and computational burden of feature distillation, enabling instant inference. Extensive evaluations on NVOS and SPIn-NeRF benchmarks demonstrate that SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (92.7\% and 95.2\% mIoU) while operating at the fastest speed at 27 ms per frame. By providing a flexible interface for diverse foundation models, our framework supports instant prompt, instance, and semantic segmentation, paving the way for interactive 3D understanding in AR/VR and robotics.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10675v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Much 3D Do Video Foundation Models Encode?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19949v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vidfm-3d-probe.github.io</p></details> |
| **[A Study of Finetuning Video Transformers for Multi-view Geometry Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18684v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an investigation of vision transformer learning for multi-view geometry tasks, such as optical flow estimation, by fine-tuning video foundation models. Unlike previous methods that involve custom architectural designs and task-specific pretraining, our research finds that general-purpose models pretrained on videos can be readily transferred to multi-view problems with minimal adaptation. The core insight is that general-purpose attention between patches learns temporal and spatial information for geometric reasoning. We demonstrate that appending a linear decoder to the Transformer backbone produces satisfactory results, and iterative refinement can further elevate performance to stateof-the-art levels. This conceptually simple approach achieves top cross-dataset generalization results for optical flow estimation with end-point error (EPE) of 0.69, 1.78, and 3.15 on the Sintel clean, Sintel final, and KITTI datasets, respectively. Our method additionally establishes a new record on the online test benchmark with EPE values of 0.79, 1.88, and F1 value of 3.79. Applications to 3D depth estimation and stereo matching also show strong performance, illustrating the versatility of video-pretrained models in addressing geometric vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 20206, Project website: geovit-aaai26.github.io</p></details> |
| **[MMGR: Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14691v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Generative Spatiotemporal Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12508v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore spatiotemporal data augmentation using video foundation models to diversify both camera viewpoints and scene dynamics. Unlike existing approaches based on simple geometric transforms or appearance perturbations, our method leverages off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate realistic 3D spatial and temporal variations from a given image dataset. Incorporating these synthesized video clips as supplemental training data yields consistent performance gains in low-data settings, such as UAV-captured imagery where annotations are scarce. Beyond empirical improvements, we provide practical guidelines for (i) choosing an appropriate spatiotemporal generative setup, (ii) transferring annotations to synthetic frames, and (iii) addressing disocclusion - regions newly revealed and unlabeled in generated views. Experiments on COCO subsets and UAV-captured datasets show that, when applied judiciously, spatiotemporal augmentation broadens the data distribution along axes underrepresented by traditional and prior generative methods, offering an effective lever for improving model performance in data-scarce regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[InternVideo-Next: Towards General Video Foundation Models without Video-Text Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01342v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video-text pretraining achieves strong performance but depends on noisy, synthetic captions with limited semantic coverage, often overlooking implicit world knowledge such as object motion, 3D geometry, and physical cues. In contrast, masked video modeling (MVM) directly exploits spatiotemporal structures but trails text-supervised methods on general tasks. We find this gap arises from overlooked architectural issues: pixel-level reconstruction struggles with convergence and its low-level requirement often conflicts with semantics, while latent prediction often encourages shortcut learning. To address these, we disentangle the traditional encoder-decoder design into an Encoder-Predictor-Decoder (EPD) framework, where the predictor acts as a latent world model, and propose InternVideo-Next, a two-stage pretraining scheme that builds a semantically consistent yet detail-preserving latent space for this world model. First, conventional linear decoder in pixel MVM enforces the predictor output latent to be linearly projected to, thus separable in pixel space, causing the conflict with semantic abstraction. Our Stage 1 proposes a conditional diffusion decoder and injects reliable image-level semantic priors to enhance semantics and convergence, thus bridging pixel-level fidelity with high-level semantic abstraction. Stage 2 further learns world knowledge by predicting frozen Stage 1 targets within this space, mitigating shortcut learning. Trained on public, unlabeled videos, InternVideo-Next achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks and provides a scalable path toward general video representation learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing semantic HOI benchmarks focused either on manipulation or on the resulting effects at a coarse level, lacking fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning to capture the underlying dynamics in HOI. We introduce HanDyVQA, a fine-grained video question-answering benchmark that comprehensively covers both the manipulation and effect aspects of HOI. HanDyVQA comprises six complementary question types (Action, Process, Objects, Location, State Change, and Object Parts), totalling 11.1K multiple-choice QA pairs. Collected QA pairs recognizing manipulation styles, hand/object motions, and part-level state changes. HanDyVQA also includes 10.3K segmentation masks for Objects and Object Parts questions, enabling the evaluation of object/part-level reasoning in video object segmentation. We evaluated recent video foundation models on our benchmark and found that even the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, reached only 73% average accuracy, which is far from human performance (97%). Further analysis shows the remaining challenges in spatial relationship, motion, and part-level geometric understanding. We also found that integrating explicit HOI-related cues into visual features improves performance, offering insights for developing future models with a deeper understanding of HOI dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://masatate.github.io/HanDyVQA-project-page/</p></details> |

Existing public datasets typically require manual YouTube crawling, which yields low usable volume due to link rot and access limits, and raises licensing uncertainty. This work addresses this challenge by introducing ViMix-14M, a curated multi-source video-text dataset of around 14 million pairs that provides crawl-free, download-ready access and long-form, high-quality captions tightly aligned to video. ViMix-14M is built by merging diverse open video sources, followed by unified de-duplication and quality filtering, and a multi-granularity, ground-truth-guided re-captioning pipeline that refines descriptions to better match actions, scenes, and temporal structure. We evaluate the dataset by multimodal retrieval, text-to-video generation, and video question answering tasks, observing consistent improvements over counterpart datasets. We hope this work can help removing the key barrier to training and fine-tuning open-source video foundation models, and provide insights of building high-quality and generalizable video-text datasets.</p></details> |  |

Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wyf0824.github.io/Video_Realism_Enhancement/</p></details> |

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.</p></details> |  |

The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EUSIPCO 2025 - 5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Pretrain to Pain: Adversarial Vulnerability of Video Foundation Models Without Task Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07049v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Video Foundation Models (VFMs) has significantly advanced various video-related tasks, either through task-specific models or Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the open accessibility of VFMs also introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video models.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Oral presentation)</p></details> |
| **[VMDT: Decoding the Trustworthiness of Video Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05682v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundation models become more sophisticated, ensuring their trustworthiness becomes increasingly critical; yet, unlike text and image, the video modality still lacks comprehensive trustworthiness benchmarks. We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and trustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework for measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

| **[VidEmo: Affective-Tree Reasoning for Emotion-Centric Video Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02712v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges. Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo), specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG) consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.</p></details> | 41 pages, 26 figures |
| **[FantasyWorld: Geometry-Consistent World Modeling via Unified Video and 3D Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21657v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable 3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception, outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Simulation with Video Foundation Models for Physical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00062v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce [Cosmos-Predict2.5], the latest generation of the Cosmos World Foundation Models for Physical AI. Built on a flow-based architecture, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World generation in a single model and leverages [Cosmos-Reason1], a Physical AI vision-language model, to provide richer text grounding and finer control of world simulation. Trained on 200M curated video clips and refined with reinforcement learning-based post-training, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] achieves substantial improvements over [Cosmos-Predict1] in video quality and instruction alignment, with models released at 2B and 14B scales. These capabilities enable more reliable synthetic data generation, policy evaluation, and closed-loop simulation for robotics and autonomous systems. We further extend the family with [Cosmos-Transfer2.5], a control-net style framework for Sim2Real and Real2Real world translation. Despite being 3.5$\times$ smaller than [Cosmos-Transfer1], it delivers higher fidelity and robust long-horizon video generation. Together, these advances establish [Cosmos-Predict2.5] and [Cosmos-Transfer2.5] as versatile tools for scaling embodied intelligence. To accelerate research and deployment in Physical AI, we release source code, pretrained checkpoints, and curated benchmarks under the NVIDIA Open Model License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5 and https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5. We hope these open resources lower the barrier to adoption and foster innovation in building the next generation of embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenLit: Reformulating Single-Image Relighting as Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11224v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating the illumination of a 3D scene within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has traditionally been addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which involve explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray-tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on large amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we exploit the implicit scene understanding of a video diffusion model, particularly Stable Video Diffusion, to relight a single image. We introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video-generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset generalizes to real-world scenes, enabling single-image relighting with plausible and convincing shadows and inter-reflections. Our results highlight the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape, and our findings indicate that such models, with minimal training, can be used to perform relighting without explicit asset reconstruction or ray-tracing. .

| **[Advances in 4D Representation: Geometry, Motion, and Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19255v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation, application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction. Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available, as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward.
