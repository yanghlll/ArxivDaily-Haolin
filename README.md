| **[UniGeoSeg: Towards Unified Open-World Segmentation for Geospatial Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23332v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-driven segmentation in remote sensing generates masks from guidance, offering great potential for accessible and generalizable applications. However, existing methods suffer from fragmented task formulations and limited instruction data, hindering effective understanding and generalization. To address these issues, we introduce GeoSeg-1M, the first million-scale dataset for remote sensing instruction-driven segmentation, constructed via an automatic mask filtering and instruction generation pipeline that synthesizes referring, interactive, and reasoning segmentation instructions from multiple public datasets. GeoSeg-1M contains 590K images, 117 categories, and 1.1M image-mask-instruction triplets. Building upon this foundation, we further curate GeoSeg-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities across diverse instruction-driven tasks and complex geospatial scenes. Furthermore, we present UniGeoSeg, a unified framework that serves as a strong baseline, incorporating task-aware text enhancement, latent knowledge memory, and a progressive training strategy to facilitate multi-task learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of UniGeoSeg across GeoSeg-Bench and diverse public benchmarks, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization.

| **[Commanding Humanoid by Free-form Language: A Large Language Action Model with Unified Motion Vocabulary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22963v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling humanoid robots to follow free-form language commands is critical for seamless human-robot interaction, collaborative task execution, and general-purpose embodied intelligence. While recent advances have improved low-level humanoid locomotion and robot manipulation, language-conditioned whole-body control remains a significant challenge. Existing methods are often limited to simple instructions and sacrifice either motion diversity or physical plausibility. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability. Extensive evaluations in simulation and on a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid show that Humanoid-LLA delivers strong language generalization while maintaining high physical fidelity, outperforming existing language-conditioned controllers in motion naturalness, stability, and execution success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://humanoidlla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[UNO: Unifying One-stage Video Scene Graph Generation via Object-Centric Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06165v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures.

| **[DDAE++: Enhancing Diffusion Models Towards Unified Generative and Discriminative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10999v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models excel at image synthesis, useful representations have been shown to emerge from generative pre-training, suggesting a path towards unified generative and discriminative learning. However, suboptimal semantic flow within current architectures can hinder this potential: features encoding the richest high-level semantics are underutilized and diluted when propagating through decoding layers, impeding the formation of an explicit semantic bottleneck layer. To address this, we introduce self-conditioning, a lightweight mechanism that reshapes the model's layer-wise semantic hierarchy without external guidance. By aggregating and rerouting intermediate features to guide subsequent decoding layers, our method concentrates more high-level semantics, concurrently strengthening global generative guidance and forming more discriminative representations. This simple approach yields a dual-improvement trend across pixel-space UNet, UViT and latent-space DiT models with minimal overhead. Crucially, it creates an architectural semantic bridge that propagates discriminative improvements into generation and accommodates further techniques such as contrastive self-distillation. Experiments show that our enhanced models, especially self-conditioned DiT, are powerful dual learners that yield strong and transferable representations on image and dense classification tasks, surpassing various generative self-supervised models in linear probing while also improving or maintaining high generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version.

| **[A Unified and Stable Risk Minimization Framework for Weakly Supervised Learning with Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22823v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised learning has emerged as a practical alternative to fully supervised learning when complete and accurate labels are costly or infeasible to acquire. However, many existing methods are tailored to specific supervision patterns -- such as positive-unlabeled (PU), unlabeled-unlabeled (UU), complementary-label (CLL), partial-label (PLL), or similarity-unlabeled annotations -- and rely on post-hoc corrections to mitigate instability induced by indirect supervision. We propose a principled, unified framework that bypasses such post-hoc adjustments by directly formulating a stable surrogate risk grounded in the structure of weakly supervised data. The formulation naturally subsumes diverse settings -- including PU, UU, CLL, PLL, multi-class unlabeled, and tuple-based learning -- under a single optimization objective. We further establish a non-asymptotic generalization bound via Rademacher complexity that clarifies how supervision structure, model capacity, and sample size jointly govern performance. Beyond this, we analyze the effect of class-prior misspecification on the bound, deriving explicit terms that quantify its impact, and we study identifiability, giving sufficient conditions -- most notably via supervision stratification across groups -- under which the target risk is recoverable. Extensive experiments show consistent gains across class priors, dataset scales, and class counts -- without heuristic stabilization -- while exhibiting robustness to overfitting.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfinityStar: Unified Spacetime AutoRegressive Modeling for Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04675v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench, outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient, high-quality video generation.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 Oral |
| **[Architecture Decoupling Is Not All You Need For Unified Multimodal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22663v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding represent a significant step toward AGI and have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zhengdian1.github.io/AIA-project/ Code: https://github.com/zhengdian1/AIA</p></details> |
| **[Arithmetic-Mean $μ$P for Modern Architectures: A Unified Learning-Rate Scale for CNNs and ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04327v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Choosing an appropriate learning rate remains a key challenge in scaling depth of modern deep networks. The classical maximal update parameterization ($μ$P) enforces a fixed per-layer update magnitude, which is well suited to homogeneous multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) but becomes ill-posed in heterogeneous architectures where residual accumulation and convolutions introduce imbalance across layers. We introduce Arithmetic-Mean $μ$P (AM-$μ$P), which constrains not each individual layer but the network-wide average one-step pre-activation second moment to a constant scale. Combined with a residual-aware He fan-in initialization - scaling residual-branch weights by the number of blocks ($\mathrm{Var}[W]=c/(K\cdot \mathrm{fan\text{-}in})$) - AM-$μ$P yields width-robust depth laws that transfer consistently across depths. We prove that, for one- and two-dimensional convolutional networks, the maximal-update learning rate satisfies $η^\star(L)\propto L^{-3/2}$; with zero padding, boundary effects are constant-level as $N\gg k$. For standard residual networks with general conv+MLP blocks, we establish $η^\star(L)=Θ(L^{-3/2})$, with $L$ the minimal depth. Empirical results across a range of depths confirm the $-3/2$ scaling law and enable zero-shot learning-rate transfer, providing a unified and practical LR principle for convolutional and deep residual networks without additional tuning overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[VinciCoder: Unifying Multimodal Code Generation via Coarse-to-fine Visual Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00391v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal code generation has garnered significant interest within the research community. Despite the notable success of recent vision-language models (VLMs) on specialized tasks like chart-to-code generation, their reliance on single-task training regimens fosters a narrow paradigm that hinders the development of generalized \textbf{VI}sio\textbf{N} \textbf{C}ode \textbf{I}ntelligence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{VinciCoder}, a unified multimodal code generation model that addresses this limitation via a two-stage training framework. We begin by constructing a large-scale Supervised Finetuning (SFT) corpus comprising 1.6M image-code pairs for tasks involving direct code generation and visual-based code refinement. Subsequently, we introduce a Visual Reinforcement Learning (ViRL) strategy, which employs a coarse-to-fine reward mechanism to improve visual fidelity by calculating visual similarity across local and global image patches. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal code generation benchmarks demonstrate that VinciCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent open-source models. The ablation study further validates the effectiveness of our proposed coarse-to-fine ViRL strategy. The data, code and model is available at https://github.com/DocTron-hub/VinciCoder.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Hybrid, Unified and Iterative: A Novel Framework for Text-based Person Anomaly Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22470v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person anomaly retrieval has emerged as a challenging task, with most existing approaches relying on complex deep-learning techniques. This raises a research question: How can the model be optimized to achieve greater fine-grained features? To address this, we propose a Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), designed to explore the effectiveness of incorporating both fine-grained features alongside coarse-grained features. Additionally, we investigate a Unified Image-Text (UIT) model that combines multiple objective loss functions, including Image-Text Contrastive (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), Masked Language Modeling (MLM), and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) loss. Beyond this, we propose a novel iterative ensemble strategy, by combining iteratively instead of using model results simultaneously like other ensemble methods. To take advantage of the superior performance of the LHP model, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm based on its guidance, which helps improve the model's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on PAB dataset, compared with previous work, with a 9.70\% improvement in R@1, 1.77\% improvement in R@5, and 1.01\% improvement in R@10.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on World Wide Web 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

We introduce Gelina, a unified framework that jointly synthesizes speech and co-speech gestures from text using interleaved token sequences in a discrete autoregressive backbone, with modality-specific decoders. Gelina supports multi-speaker and multi-style cloning and enables gesture-only synthesis from speech inputs. Subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate competitive speech quality and improved gesture generation over unimodal baselines.</p></details> | 5 pages |

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is effective for identifying dependencies and mitigating security risks. However, existing SBOM solutions lack precision, particularly in binary analysis and non-package-managed languages like C/C++. This paper introduces UniBOM, an advanced tool for SBOM generation, analysis, and visualisation, designed to enhance the security accountability of networked systems. UniBOM integrates binary, filesystem, and source code analysis, enabling fine-grained vulnerability detection and risk management. Key features include historical CPE tracking, AI-based vulnerability classification by severity and memory safety, and support for non-package-managed C/C++ dependencies. UniBOM's effectiveness is demonstrated through a comparative vulnerability analysis of 258 wireless router firmware binaries and the source code of four popular IoT operating systems, highlighting its superior detection capabilities compared to other widely used SBOM generation and analysis tools. Packaged for open-source distribution, UniBOM offers an end-to-end unified analysis and visualisation solution, advancing SBOM-driven security management for dependable networked systems and broader software.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the ACM 15th International Conference on the Internet of Things (ACM IoT 2025)</p></details> |
| **[UMind-VL: A Generalist Ultrasound Vision-Language Model for Unified Grounded Perception and Comprehensive Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22256v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant strides in medical foundation models, the ultrasound domain lacks a comprehensive solution capable of bridging low-level Ultrasound Grounded Perception (e.g., segmentation, localization) and high-level Ultrasound Comprehensive Interpretation (e.g., diagnosis, reasoning). To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.</p></details> |  |

We present PULSE-ICU, a self-supervised foundation model that learns event-level ICU representations from large-scale EHR sequences without resampling or manual feature engineering. A unified embedding module encodes event identity, continuous values, units, and temporal attributes, while a Longformer-based encoder enables efficient modeling of long trajectories. PULSE-ICU was fine-tuned across 18 prediction tasks, including mortality, intervention forecasting, and phenotype identification, achieving strong performance across task types. External validation on eICU, HiRID, and P12 showed substantial improvements with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness to domain shift and variable constraints. These findings suggest that foundation-style modeling can improve data efficiency and adaptability, providing a scalable framework for ICU decision support across diverse clinical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[G$^2$VLM: Geometry Grounded Vision Language Model with Unified 3D Reconstruction and Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21688v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code are released at https://github.com/InternRobotics/G2VLM</p></details> |
| **[From Topology to Retrieval: Decoding Embedding Spaces with Unified Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22150v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying how embeddings are organized in space not only enhances model interpretability but also uncovers factors that drive downstream task performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of topological and geometric measures across a wide set of text embedding models and datasets. We find a high degree of redundancy among these measures and observe that individual metrics often fail to sufficiently differentiate embedding spaces. Building on these insights, we introduce Unified Topological Signatures (UTS), a holistic framework for characterizing embedding spaces. We show that UTS can predict model-specific properties and reveal similarities driven by model architecture. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our method by linking topological structure to ranking effectiveness and accurately predicting document retrievability. We find that a holistic, multi-attribute perspective is essential to understanding and leveraging the geometry of text embeddings.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamO: A Unified Framework for Image Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16915v5)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, extensive research on image customization (e.g., identity, subject, style, background, etc.) demonstrates strong customization capabilities in large-scale generative models. However, most approaches are designed for specific tasks, restricting their generalizability to combine different types of condition. Developing a unified framework for image customization remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present DreamO, an image customization framework designed to support a wide range of tasks while facilitating seamless integration of multiple conditions. Specifically, DreamO utilizes a diffusion transformer (DiT) framework to uniformly process input of different types. During training, we construct a large-scale training dataset that includes various customization tasks, and we introduce a feature routing constraint to facilitate the precise querying of relevant information from reference images. Additionally, we design a placeholder strategy that associates specific placeholders with conditions at particular positions, enabling control over the placement of conditions in the generated results. Moreover, we employ a progressive training strategy consisting of three stages: an initial stage focused on simple tasks with limited data to establish baseline consistency, a full-scale training stage to comprehensively enhance the customization capabilities, and a final quality alignment stage to correct quality biases introduced by low-quality data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DreamO can effectively perform various image customization tasks with high quality and flexibly integrate different types of control conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwordRiding: A Unified Navigation Framework for Quadrotors in Unknown Complex Environments via Online Guiding Vector Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22043v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although quadrotor navigation has achieved high performance in trajectory planning and control, real-time adaptability in unknown complex environments remains a core challenge. This difficulty mainly arises because most existing planning frameworks operate in an open-loop manner, making it hard to cope with environmental uncertainties such as wind disturbances or external perturbations. This paper presents a unified real-time navigation framework for quadrotors in unknown complex environments, based on the online construction of guiding vector fields (GVFs) from discrete reference path points. In the framework, onboard perception modules build a Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) representation of the environment, which enables obstacle awareness and path distance evaluation. The system first generates discrete, collision-free path points using a global planner, and then parameterizes them via uniform B-splines to produce a smooth and physically feasible reference trajectory. An adaptive GVF is then synthesized from the ESDF and the optimized B-spline trajectory. Unlike conventional approaches, the method adopts a closed-loop navigation paradigm, which significantly enhances robustness under external disturbances. Compared with conventional GVF methods, the proposed approach directly accommodates discretized paths and maintains compatibility with standard planning algorithms. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate improved robustness against external disturbances and superior real-time performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For an experimental demo, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKYCg266c4o.

| **[Identifying all snarls and superbubbles in linear-time, via a unified SPQR-tree framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21919v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snarls and superbubbles are fundamental pangenome decompositions capturing variant sites. These bubble-like structures underpin key tasks in computational pangenomics, including structural-variant genotyping, distance indexing, haplotype sampling, and variant annotation. Snarls can be quadratically-many in the size of the graph, and since their introduction in 2018 with the vg toolkit, there has been no work on identifying all snarls in linear time. Moreover, while it is known how to find superbubbles in linear time, this result is a highly specialized solution only achieved after a long series of papers. We present the first algorithm identifying all snarls in linear time. This is based on a new representation of all snarls, of size linear in the input graph size, and which can be computed in linear time. Our algorithm is based on a unified framework that also provides a new linear-time algorithm for finding superbubbles. An observation behind our results is that all such structures are separated from the rest of the graph by two vertices (except for cases which are trivially computable), i.e. their endpoints are a 2-separator of the underlying undirected graph. Based on this, we employ the well-known SPQR tree decomposition, which encodes all 2-separators, to guide a traversal that finds the bubble-like structures efficiently. We implemented our algorithms in C++ (available at https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder) and evaluated them on various pangenomic datasets. Our algorithms outcompete or they are on the same level of existing methods. For snarls, we are up to two times faster than vg, while identifying all snarls. When computing superbubbles, we are up to 50 times faster than BubbleGun. Our SPQR tree framework provides a unifying perspective on bubble-like structures in pangenomics, together with a template for finding other bubble-like structures efficiently.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present UniArt, a diffusion-based framework that directly synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image in an end-to-end manner. Unlike prior multi-stage techniques, UniArt establishes a unified latent representation that jointly encodes geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. We introduce a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding, which spatially aligns articulation features with volumetric geometry, enabling the model to learn coherent motion behaviors alongside structural formation. Furthermore, we formulate articulation type prediction as an open-set problem, removing the need for fixed joint semantics and allowing generalization to novel joint categories and unseen object types. Experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that UniArt achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Video-R2: Reinforcing Consistent and Grounded Reasoning in Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23478v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video-R2 Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[Video-CoM: Interactive Video Reasoning via Chain of Manipulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23477v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced video understanding, yet most still "think about videos" ie once a video is encoded, reasoning unfolds entirely in text, treating visual input as a static context. This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[DisMo: Disentangled Motion Representations for Open-World Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23428v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

| **[DualCamCtrl: Dual-Branch Diffusion Model for Geometry-Aware Camera-Controlled Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23127v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents DualCamCtrl, a novel end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation. Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

| **[Predicting Video Slot Attention Queries from Random Slot-Feature Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01345v5)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables object-level scene representation and understanding as we humans do. Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame. This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both (\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction (RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction; (\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also benefits downstream tasks like scene understanding.

By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[McSc: Motion-Corrective Preference Alignment for Video Generation with Self-Critic Hierarchical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22974v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods overlook the importance of individual words, treating the entire text query and video clips as a black-box, which hinders contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables fine-grained clip filtering by identifying and prioritizing important words in the query. Our method integrates image-text scene understanding through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enhances the semantic understanding of video clips. We introduce a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture important words from the query and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to iteratively refine video clips based on their relevance to these important words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both MR and HD tasks.

| **[Modeling Chaotic Pedestrian Behavior Using Chaos Indicators and Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22887v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cities around the world aim to improve walkability and safety, understanding the irregular and unpredictable nature of pedestrian behavior has become increasingly important. This study introduces a data-driven framework for modeling chaotic pedestrian movement using empirically observed trajectory data and supervised learning. Videos were recorded during both daytime and nighttime conditions to capture pedestrian dynamics under varying ambient and traffic contexts. Pedestrian trajectories were extracted through computer vision techniques, and behavioral chaos was quantified using four chaos metrics: Approximate Entropy and Lyapunov Exponent, each computed for both velocity and direction change. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to consolidate these indicators into a unified chaos score. A comprehensive set of individual, group-level, and contextual traffic features was engineered and used to train Random Forest and CatBoost regression models. CatBoost models consistently achieved superior performance. The best daytime PCA-based CatBoost model reached an R^2 of 0.8319, while the nighttime PCA-based CatBoost model attained an R^2 of 0.8574. SHAP analysis highlighted that features such as distance travel, movement duration, and speed variability were robust contributors to chaotic behavior. The proposed framework enables practitioners to quantify and anticipate behavioral instability in real-world settings. Planners and engineers can use chaos scores to identify high-risk pedestrian zones, apprise infrastructure improvements, and calibrate realistic microsimulation models. The approach also supports adaptive risk assessment in automated vehicle systems by capturing short-term motion unpredictability grounded in observable, interpretable features.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReAG: Reasoning-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22715v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in jointly understanding text, images, and videos, often evaluated via Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

| **[Beyond Real versus Fake Towards Intent-Aware Video Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22455v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative models has led to increasingly realistic deepfake videos, posing significant societal and security risks. While existing detection methods focus on distinguishing real from fake videos, such approaches fail to address a fundamental question: What is the intent behind a manipulated video? Towards addressing this question, we introduce IntentHQ: a new benchmark for human-centered intent analysis, shifting the paradigm from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos. IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including "Financial fraud", "Indirect marketing", "Political propaganda", as well as "Fear mongering". We perform intent recognition with supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models that integrate spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis to infer underlying motivations and goals behind videos. Our proposed model is streamlined to differentiate between a wide range of intent-categories.</p></details> |  |

It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.</p></details> | 42 pages |

We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code are released at https://github.com/InternRobotics/G2VLM</p></details> |

Despite their simplicity, these methods, which lack target specificity, limit players' ability to give complex tactical instructions and hinder immersive gameplay experiences. To address this problem, we propose the FPS AI Companion who Understands Language (F.A.C.U.L.), the first real-time AI system that enables players to communicate and collaborate with AI companions using natural language. By integrating natural language processing with a confidence-based framework, F.A.C.U.L. efficiently decomposes complex commands and interprets player intent. It also employs a dynamic entity retrieval method for environmental awareness, aligning human intentions with decision-making. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our method supports real-time language interactions, enabling players to issue complex commands such as ``clear the second floor'', ``take cover behind that tree'', or ``retreat to the river''. The system provides real-time behavioral responses and vocal feedback, ensuring seamless tactical collaboration. Using the popular FPS game \textit{Arena Breakout: Infinite} as a case study, we present comparisons demonstrating the efficacy of our approach and discuss the advantages and limitations of AI companions based on real-world user feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures,</p></details> |

Existing approaches (e.g., sparse sampling, dense sampling with low resolution, and token compression) suffer from significant information loss in temporal dynamics, spatial details, or subtle interactions, particularly in videos with complex motion or varying resolutions. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{Mavors}$, a novel framework that introduces $\mathbf{M}$ulti-gr$\mathbf{a}$nularity $\mathbf{v}$ide$\mathbf{o}$ $\mathbf{r}$epre$\mathbf{s}$entation for holistic long-video modeling. Specifically, Mavors directly encodes raw video content into latent representations through two core components: 1) an Intra-chunk Vision Encoder (IVE) that preserves high-resolution spatial features via 3D convolutions and Vision Transformers, and 2) an Inter-chunk Feature Aggregator (IFA) that establishes temporal coherence across chunks using transformer-based dependency modeling with chunk-level rotary position encodings. Moreover, the framework unifies image and video understanding by treating images as single-frame videos via sub-image decomposition. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate Mavors' superiority in maintaining both spatial fidelity and temporal continuity, significantly outperforming existing methods in tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[ROVER: Recursive Reasoning Over Videos with Vision-Language Models for Embodied Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01943v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach, on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over baselines.

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline. We introduce a new dataset and benchmark, TAPVid360-10k comprising 10k perspective videos with ground truth directional point tracking. Our baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates, outperforming existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.</p></details> |  |

Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xuboshen.github.io/TimeViper; Code: https://github.com/xiaomi-research/timeviper</p></details> |

To do this, video understanding models must be able to obtain structured understandings, such as the temporal segmentation of a demonstration into sequences of actions and skills, and to generalize the understandings to novel environments, tasks, and problem domains. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Spacewalk-18, a benchmark containing two tasks: (1) step recognition and (2) video question answering, over a dataset of temporally segmented and labeled tasks in International Space Station spacewalk recordings. In tandem, the two tasks quantify a model's ability to: (1) generalize to novel domains; (2) utilize long temporal context and multimodal (e.g. visual and speech) information. Our extensive experimental analysis highlights the challenges of Spacewalk-18, but also suggests best practices for domain generalization and long-form understanding. Notably, we discover a promising adaptation via summarization technique that leads to significant performance improvement without model fine-tuning. The Spacewalk-18 benchmark is released at https://brown-palm.github.io/Spacewalk-18/.</p></details> | WACV 2026 |

While navigation has been well-explored, physically meaningful interactions that mimic real-world forces remain largely understudied. In this work, we investigate using physical forces as a control signal for video generation and propose force prompts which enable users to interact with images through both localized point forces, such as poking a plant, and global wind force fields, such as wind blowing on fabric. We demonstrate that these force prompts can enable videos to respond realistically to physical control signals by leveraging the visual and motion prior in the original pretrained model, without using any 3D asset or physics simulator at inference. The primary challenge of force prompting is the difficulty in obtaining high quality paired force-video training data, both in the real world due to the difficulty of obtaining force signals, and in synthetic data due to limitations in the visual quality and domain diversity of physics simulators. Our key finding is that video generation models can generalize remarkably well when adapted to follow physical force conditioning from videos synthesized by Blender, even with limited demonstrations of few objects. Our method can generate videos which simulate forces across diverse geometries, settings, and materials. We also try to understand the source of this generalization and perform ablations that reveal two key elements: visual diversity and the use of specific text keywords during training. Our approach is trained on only around 15k training examples for a single day on four A100 GPUs, and outperforms existing methods on force adherence and physics realism, bringing world models closer to real-world physics interactions.

Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |

Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

| **[CtrlVDiff: Controllable Video Generation via Unified Multimodal Video Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21129v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation. However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations. We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 18 figures, 9 tables.

| **[Thinking by Doing: Building Efficient World Model Reasoning in LLMs via Multi-turn Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23476v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing robust world model reasoning is crucial for large language model (LLM) agents to plan and interact in complex environments. While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SmallWorlds: Assessing Dynamics Understanding of World Models in Isolated Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23465v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current world models lack a unified and controlled setting for systematic evaluation, making it difficult to assess whether they truly capture the underlying rules that govern environment dynamics. In this work, we address this open challenge by introducing the SmallWorld Benchmark, a testbed designed to assess world model capability under isolated and precisely controlled dynamics without relying on handcrafted reward signals. Using this benchmark, we conduct comprehensive experiments in the fully observable state space on representative architectures including Recurrent State Space Model, Transformer, Diffusion model, and Neural ODE, examining their behavior across six distinct domains. The experimental results reveal how effectively these models capture environment structure and how their predictions deteriorate over extended rollouts, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of current modeling paradigms and offering insights into future improvement directions in representation learning and dynamics modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Price of Progress: Algorithmic Efficiency and the Falling Cost of AI Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23455v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have seen enormous progress on advanced benchmarks in recent years, but much of this progress has only been possible by using more costly models. Benchmarks may therefore present a warped picture of progress in practical capabilities per dollar. To remedy this, we use data from Artificial Analysis and Epoch AI to form the largest dataset of current and historical prices to run benchmarks to date. We find that the price for a given level of benchmark performance has decreased remarkably fast, around $5\times$ to $10\times$ per year, for frontier models on knowledge, reasoning, math, and software engineering benchmarks. These reductions in the cost of AI inference are due to economic forces, hardware efficiency improvements, and algorithmic efficiency improvements. Isolating out open models to control for competition effects and dividing by hardware price declines, we estimate that algorithmic efficiency progress is around $3\times$ per year. Finally, we recommend that evaluators both publicize and take into account the price of benchmarking as an essential part of measuring the real-world impact of AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-Centric Data Synthesis for Category-level Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23450v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches to object detection have achieved reliable detection of specific object classes in images. However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Towards Continuous Intelligence Growth: Self-Training, Continual Learning, and Dual-Scale Memory in SuperIntelliAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23436v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SuperIntelliAgent, an agentic learning framework that couples a trainable small diffusion model (the learner) with a frozen large language model (the verifier) to enable continual intelligence growth through self-supervised interaction. Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Uncovering Zero-Shot Generalization Gaps in Time-Series Foundation Models Using Real-World Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26347v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on time-series foundation models (TSFMs) has underscored the scarcity of real-world data, often supplemented with synthetic sources in existing datasets, whose generalizability remains however debated. As such, in this work, we propose a novel benchmarking approach: in particular, we aim at building a curated dataset reflecting real world physical temporal dynamics, extracting temporal signals from real-world videos using optical flow. As such, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on state-of-the-art TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting show that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, suggesting limited generalizability to novel datasets. These findings underscore the need for novel approaches to acquiring time series data and highlight the lack of universality in recent TSFMs, while further validating the effectiveness of our video-based time series data extraction pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS) Workshop @ AAAI 2026: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications</p></details> |
| **[Hunyuan-GameCraft-2: Instruction-following Interactive Game World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23429v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative world models have enabled remarkable progress in creating open-ended game environments, evolving from static scene synthesis toward dynamic, interactive simulation. However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Project page:https://hunyuan-gamecraft-2.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[DisMo: Disentangled Motion Representations for Open-World Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23428v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

| **[A Hierarchical Computer Vision Pipeline for Physiological Data Extraction from Bedside Monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23355v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many low-resource healthcare settings, bedside monitors remain standalone legacy devices without network connectivity, creating a persistent interoperability gap that prevents seamless integration of physiological data into electronic health record (EHR) systems. To address this challenge without requiring costly hardware replacement, we present a computer vision-based pipeline for the automated capture and digitisation of vital sign data directly from bedside monitor screens. Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured information from screen captures into structured digital data, providing a practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[LLMAID: Identifying AI Capabilities in Android Apps with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19059v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and its widespread integration into mobile software applications have received significant attention, highlighting the growing prominence of AI capabilities in modern software systems. However, the inherent hallucination and reliability issues of AI continue to raise persistent concerns. Consequently, application users and regulators increasingly ask critical questions such as: Does the application incorporate AI capabilities? and What specific types of AI functionalities are embedded? Preliminary efforts have been made to identify AI capabilities in mobile software; however, existing approaches mainly rely on manual inspection and rule-based heuristics. These methods are not only costly and time-consuming but also struggle to adapt advanced AI techniques. To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose LLMAID (Large Language Model for AI Discovery). LLMAID includes four main tasks: (1) candidate extraction, (2) knowledge base interaction, (3) AI capability analysis and detection, and (4) AI service summarization. We apply LLMAID to a dataset of 4,201 Android applications and demonstrate that it identifies 242% more real-world AI apps than state-of-the-art rule-based approaches. Our experiments show that LLM4AID achieves high precision and recall, both exceeding 90%, in detecting AI-related components. Additionally, a user study indicates that developers find the AI service summaries generated by LLMAID to be more informative and preferable to the original app descriptions. Finally, we leverage LLMAID to perform an empirical analysis of AI capabilities across Android apps. The results reveal a strong concentration of AI functionality in computer vision (54.80%), with object detection emerging as the most common task (25.19%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Chart2Code-MoLA: Efficient Multi-Modal Code Generation via Adaptive Expert Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23321v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chart-to-code generation is a critical task in automated data visualization, translating complex chart structures into executable programs. While recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) improve chart representation, existing approaches still struggle to achieve cross-type generalization, memory efficiency, and modular design. To address these challenges, this paper proposes C2C-MoLA, a multimodal framework that synergizes Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The MoE component uses a complexity-aware routing mechanism with domain-specialized experts and load-balanced sparse gating, dynamically allocating inputs based on learnable structural metrics like element count and chart complexity. LoRA enables parameter-efficient updates for resource-conscious tuning, further supported by a tailored training strategy that aligns routing stability with semantic accuracy. Experiments on Chart2Code-160k show that the proposed model improves generation accuracy by up to 17%, reduces peak GPU memory by 18%, and accelerates convergence by 20%, when compared to standard fine-tuning and LoRA-only baselines, particularly on complex charts. Ablation studies validate optimal designs, such as 8 experts and rank-8 LoRA, and confirm scalability for real-world multimodal code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAMA: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models with Causal Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02583v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician (\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit, reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies. To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph, which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Curve Fitting: Neuro-Symbolic Agents for Context-Aware Epidemic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23276v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective surveillance of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) requires forecasts accounting for epidemiological patterns and contextual drivers like school calendars and weather. While classical models and recent foundation models (e.g., Chronos, TimesFM) incorporate covariates, they often lack the semantic reasoning to interpret the causal interplay between conflicting drivers. In this work, we propose a two-agent framework decoupling contextual interpretation from probabilistic forecasting. An LLM "event interpreter" processes heterogeneous signals-including school schedules, meteorological summaries, and reports-into a scalar transmission-impact signal. A neuro-symbolic core then combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts. We evaluate the framework on real-world HFMD datasets from Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024). Compared to traditional and foundation-model baselines, our approach achieves competitive point forecasting accuracy while providing robust 90% prediction intervals (coverage 0.85-1.00) and human-interpretable rationales. Our results suggest that structurally integrating domain knowledge through LLMs can match state-of-the-art performance while yielding context-aware forecasts that align with public health workflows.

| **[Network Inversion for Uncertainty-Aware Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23448v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and uncertainty estimation (UE) are critical components for building safe machine learning systems, especially in real-world scenarios where unexpected inputs are inevitable. However the two problems have, until recently, separately been addressed. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class, initially populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution data more closely, with a significant drop in the uncertainty, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and uncertainty estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous Image Quality Improvement and Artefacts Correction in Accelerated MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23274v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MR data are acquired in the frequency domain, known as k-space. Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[BanglaSentNet: An Explainable Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Multi-Aspect Sentiment Analysis with Cross-Domain Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23264v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-aspect sentiment analysis of Bangla e-commerce reviews remains challenging due to limited annotated datasets, morphological complexity, code-mixing phenomena, and domain shift issues, affecting 300 million Bangla-speaking users. Existing approaches lack explainability and cross-domain generalization capabilities crucial for practical deployment. We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement. This research establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for Bangla sentiment analysis, advances ensemble learning methodologies for low-resource languages, and provides actionable solutions for commercial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Springer Nature Computer Science (SNCS) as an extended version of our ICDSAIA 2025 conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Forecasting via Direct Per-Step Probability Distribution Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23260v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural network-based time series prediction models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, it is challenging for these models to account for uncertainty associated with their predictions, because they directly output scalar values at each time step. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel model named interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN), which directly constructs discrete probability distributions per step instead of a scalar. The regression output at each time step is derived by computing the expectation of the predictive distribution on a predefined support set. To mitigate prediction anomalies, a dual-branch architecture is introduced with interleaved support sets, augmented by coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trend forecasting. Outputs from another branch are treated as auxiliary signals to impose self-supervised consistency constraints on the current branch's prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of interPDN.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures.

| **[One-Shot Secure Aggregation: A Hybrid Cryptographic Protocol for Private Federated Learning in IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23252v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach to collaboratively train machine learning models without centralizing raw data, yet its scalability is often throttled by excessive communication overhead. This challenge is magnified in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where devices face stringent bandwidth, latency, and energy constraints. Conventional secure aggregation protocols, while essential for protecting model updates, frequently require multiple interaction rounds, large payload sizes, and per-client costs rendering them impractical for many edge deployments. In this work, we present Hyb-Agg, a lightweight and communication-efficient secure aggregation protocol that integrates Multi-Key CKKS (MK-CKKS) homomorphic encryption with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)-based additive masking. Hyb-Agg reduces the secure aggregation process to a single, non-interactive client-to-server transmission per round, ensuring that per-client communication remains constant regardless of the number of participants. This design eliminates partial decryption exchanges, preserves strong privacy under the RLWE, CDH, and random oracle assumptions, and maintains robustness against collusion by the server and up to $N-2$ clients. We implement and evaluate Hyb-Agg on both high-performance and resource-constrained devices, including a Raspberry Pi 4, demonstrating that it delivers sub-second execution times while achieving a constant communication expansion factor of approximately 12x over plaintext size. By directly addressing the communication bottleneck, Hyb-Agg enables scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning that is practical for real-world IoT deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures.

While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods. Our findings offer actionable insights for efficiently bridging the sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from models trained exclusively on synthetic data.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SDE-Attention, a family of SDE-RNNs equipped with channel-level attention on the latent pre-RNN state, including channel recalibration, time-varying feature attention, and pyramidal multi-scale self-attention. We therefore conduct a comparison on a synthetic periodic dataset and real-world benchmarks, under varying missing rate. Latent-space attention consistently improves over a vanilla SDE-RNN. On the univariate UCR datasets, the LSTM-based time-varying feature model SDE-TVF-L achieves the highest average accuracy, raising mean performance by approximately 4, 6, and 10 percentage points over the baseline at 30%, 60% and 90% missingness, respectively (averaged across datasets). On multivariate UEA benchmarks, attention-augmented models again outperform the backbone, with SDE-TVF-L yielding up to a 7% gain in mean accuracy under high missingness. Among the proposed mechanisms, time-varying feature attention is the most robust on univariate datasets. On multivariate datasets, different attention types excel on different tasks, showing that SDE-Attention can be flexibly adapted to the structure of each problem.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Incorporating Ephemeral Traffic Waves in A Data-Driven Framework for Microsimulation in CARLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23236v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a data-driven traffic microsimulation framework in CARLA that reconstructs real-world wave dynamics using high-fidelity time-space data from the I-24 MOTION testbed. Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of "visible" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE IV 2026</p></details> |

Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries. Experiments on our real-world tea plantation dataset containing six pest and disease categories demonstrate that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, 97.10% mAP@50 and 76.90% mAP@50:95, outperforming the YOLOv8n baseline by 2.34, 4.68, 1.40 and 1.80 percentage points respectively, while reducing parameters by 16.7%. Comparative experiments further confirm that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves superior performance over mainstream detection models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAPS: Guiding Dynamic Android Analysis with Static Path Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23213v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamically resolving method reachability in Android applications remains a critical and largely unsolved problem. Despite notable advancements in GUI testing and static call graph construction, current tools are insufficient for reliably driving execution toward specific target methods, especially those not embedded in a graphical component (e.g., libraries' methods), a capability essential for tasks such as vulnerability validation, debugging, and behavioral analysis. We present GAPS (Graph-based Automated Path Synthesizer), the first system that integrates static, method-guided call graph analysis with dynamic, interaction-driven execution. GAPS performs a lightweight backward traversal of the call graph, guided by data-flow analysis, to reconstruct paths reaching the target methods. These paths are then translated into instructions that guide runtime app exploration. On the AndroTest benchmark, GAPS statically identifies paths to reach 88.24\% of the target methods in just 4.27 seconds per app and dynamically reaches 57.44\% of them. In contrast, state-of-the-art dynamic interaction tools show significantly lower reachability over three runs: APE, one of the best model-based GUI testers, achieves 12.82\%, while GoalExplorer, a hybrid analysis tool, reaches 9.69\%, and Guardian, an LLM-based UI automator, reaches 17.12\%. Static analysis tools also fall short: FlowDroid and DroidReach identify paths to reach 58.81\% and 9.48\% of the targets, requiring 35.06 seconds and 23.46 seconds per app, respectively. Finally, an evaluation on the 50 most downloaded real-world apps demonstrates GAPS's practical utility in analyzing security-critical code under a realistic scenario. With an average static analysis time of 278.9 seconds, GAPS statically reconstructs paths to 62.03\% of the target methods and dynamically reaches 59.86\% of them.</p></details> |  |

Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video-R2 Technical Report</p></details> |

However, high network communication costs are always an impediment to split learning, especially for large foundation models that require transmitting large amounts of high-dimensional data. To resolve this issue, we present a new multimodal model structure that incorporates a learning-based data compression method, which compresses model embeddings into low-bit integers while preserving the model's performance, greatly reducing the transmission costs between partitions. We then determine the optimal number of discrete representation levels based on a solid theoretical foundation from entropy coding.</p></details> | 14pages, 5 figures |
| **[VQRAE: Representation Quantization Autoencoders for Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23386v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying multimodal understanding, generation and reconstruction representation in a single tokenizer remains a key challenge in building unified models. Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Optimizing Multimodal Language Models through Attention-based Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23375v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern large language models become multimodal, analyzing various data formats like text and images. While fine-tuning is effective for adapting these multimodal language models (MLMs) to downstream tasks, full fine-tuning is computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by training only a small portion of model weights. However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. This indicates that fine-tuning a small percentage (around 0.01%) of parameters in these crucial layers can substantially influence image understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICAI-2025 conference</p></details> |

Author intent understanding plays a crucial role in interpreting social media content. This paper addresses author intent classification in Bangla social media posts by leveraging both textual and visual data. Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification. Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning. This research establishes new benchmarks and methodological standards for Bangla and other low-resource languages. We call our proposed framework BangACMM (Bangla Author Content MultiModal).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT 2025).

| **[OctoMed: Data Recipes for State-of-the-Art Multimodal Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23269v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality and carefully curated data is a cornerstone of training medical large language models, as it directly impacts both generalization and robustness to unseen clinical tasks. We investigate strategies for training and data curation to develop a robust multimodal reasoning model in the medical domain. Our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and explores data recipes that leverage structured reasoning traces. Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks. Our results further indicate that curating a high-quality, diverse training dataset with varying structured reasoning trace lengths enables the fine-tuned model to self-calibrate its reasoning trajectory lengths based on the downstream task, without explicit supervision. We present key insights, describe the data curation strategy, and outline next steps toward developing robust medical vision-language reasoning system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Confusion Attack: Disrupting Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20494v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Adversarial Confusion Attack, a new class of threats against multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, the goal is to induce systematic disruption that makes the model generate incoherent or confidently incorrect outputs. Applications include embedding adversarial images into websites to prevent MLLM-powered agents from operating reliably. The proposed attack maximizes next-token entropy using a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs. In the white-box setting, we show that a single adversarial image can disrupt all models in the ensemble, both in the full-image and adversarial CAPTCHA settings. Despite relying on a basic adversarial technique (PGD), the attack generates perturbations that transfer to both unseen open-source (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-5.1) models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Buffer replay enhances the robustness of multimodal learning under missing-modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23070v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing modalities consistently lead to significant performance degradation in multimodal models. Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoadFed: A Multimodal Federated Learning System for Improving Road Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09978v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internet of Things (IoTs) have been widely applied in Collaborative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) for the prevention of road accidents. As one of the primary causes of road accidents in C-ITS, the efficient detection and early alarm of road hazards are of paramount importance. Given the importance, extensive research has explored this topic and obtained favorable results. However, most existing solutions only explore single-modality data, struggle with high computation and communication overhead, or suffer from the curse of high dimensionality in their privacy-preserving methodologies. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper, we introduce RoadFed, an innovative and private multimodal Federated learning-based system tailored for intelligent Road hazard detection and alarm. This framework encompasses an innovative Multimodal Road Hazard Detector, a communication-efficient federated learning approach, and a customized low-error-rate local differential privacy method crafted for high dimensional multimodal data. Experimental results reveal that the proposed RoadFed surpasses most existing systems in the self-gathered real-world and CrisisMMD public datasets. In particular, RoadFed achieves an accuracy of 96.42% with a mere 0.0351 seconds of latency and its communication cost is up to 1,000 times lower than existing systems in this field. It facilitates collaborative training with non-iid high dimensional multimodal real-world data across various data modalities on multiple edges while ensuring privacy preservation for road users.</p></details> |  |
| **[TIM-PRM: Verifying multimodal reasoning with Tool-Integrated PRM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22998v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performances in mathematical reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies that standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[HMR3D: Hierarchical Multimodal Representation for 3D Scene Understanding with Large Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22961v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant promise for 3D scene understanding. Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Multimodal Learning Via Multi-Level Adaptive DeConfusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19674v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning enhances the performance of various machine learning tasks by leveraging complementary information across different modalities. However, existing methods often learn multimodal representations that retain substantial inter-class confusion, making it difficult to achieve high-confidence predictions, particularly in real-world scenarios with low-quality or noisy data. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Level Adaptive DeConfusion (MLAD), which eliminates inter-class confusion in multimodal data at both global and sample levels, significantly enhancing the classification reliability of multimodal models. Specifically, MLAD first learns class-wise latent distributions with global-level confusion removed via dynamic-exit modality encoders that adapt to the varying discrimination difficulty of each class and a cross-class residual reconstruction mechanism. Subsequently, MLAD further removes sample-specific confusion through sample-adaptive cross-modality rectification guided by confusion-free modality priors. These priors are constructed from low-confusion modality features, identified by evaluating feature confusion using the learned class-wise latent distributions and selecting those with low confusion via a Gaussian mixture model. Experiments demonstrate that MLAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks and exhibits superior reliability.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, the integration of multiple modalities introduces heterogeneity in both the model and training data, creating unique systems challenges. We propose DistTrain, a disaggregated training system for multimodal LLMs. DistTrain incorporates two novel disaggregation techniques to address model and data heterogeneity, respectively. The first is disaggregated model orchestration, which separates the training for modality encoder, LLM backbone, and modality generator. This allows the three components to adaptively and independently orchestrate their resources and parallelism configurations. The second is disaggregated data preprocessing, which decouples data preprocessing from training. This eliminates resource contention between preprocessing and training, and enables efficient data reordering to mitigate stragglers within and between microbatches caused by data heterogeneity. We evaluate DistTrain across different sizes of multimodal LLMs on a large-scale production cluster. The experimental results show that DistTrain achieves 54.7% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) when training a 72B multimodal LLM on 1172 GPUs and outperforms Megatron-LM by up to 2.2x on training throughput.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGCO...</summary><p>SIGCOMM 2025 (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3718958.3750472)</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment for Multimodal Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22862v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables online model adaptation using only unlabeled test data, aiming to bridge the gap between source and target distributions. However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment. Extensive experiments on MMTTA tasks, including both corruption-based and real-world domain shift benchmarks, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

As the highly dynamic and complex human motion covering various styles and genres, dance generation requires satisfying diverse conditions beyond just music (e.g., spatial trajectories, keyframe gestures, or style descriptions). However, the absence of a large-scale and richly annotated dataset severely hinders progress. In this paper, we build OpenDanceSet, an extensive human dance dataset comprising over 100 hours across 14 genres and 147 subjects. Each sample has rich annotations to facilitate robust cross-modal learning: 3D motion, paired music, 2D keypoints, trajectories, and expert-annotated text descriptions. Furthermore, we propose OpenDanceNet, a unified masked modeling framework for controllable dance generation, including a disentangled auto-encoder and a multimodal joint-prediction Transformer. OpenDanceNet supports generation conditioned on music and arbitrary combinations of text, keypoints, or trajectories. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our work achieves high-fidelity synthesis with strong diversity and realistic physical contacts, while also offering flexible control over spatial and stylistic conditions.

| **[Breaking the Visual Shortcuts in Multimodal Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22843v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Multimodal Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (MKB-VQA) benchmarks suffer from "visual shortcuts", as the query image typically matches the primary subject entity of the target document. We demonstrate that models can exploit these shortcuts, achieving comparable results using visual cues alone. To address this, we introduce Relational Entity Text-Image kNowledge Augmented (RETINA) benchmark, automatically constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline, consisting of 120k training and 2k human-curated test set. RETINA contains queries referencing secondary subjects (i.e. related entities) and pairs them with images of these related entities, removing the visual shortcut. When evaluated on RETINA existing models show significantly degraded performance, confirming their reliance on the shortcut. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Image MultImodal Retriever (MIMIR), which enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities, effectively handling RETINA, unlike prior work that uses only a single image per document. Our experiments validate the limitations of existing benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of RETINA and MIMIR. Our project is available at: Project Page.</p></details> |  |

To rigorously study this, we introduce MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks that probe a model's reliance on specific modalities. Using black-box and white-box interpretability techniques, we provide a critical analysis of the brittleness of both open- and closed-sourced MLLMs. We show that current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, thereby lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding. This work provides both interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning.

| **[MolEdit: Knowledge Editing for Multimodal Molecule Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12770v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and continuously refining multimodal molecular knowledge is crucial for advancing biomedicine, chemistry, and materials science. Molecule language models (MoLMs) have become powerful tools in these domains, integrating structural representations (e.g., SMILES strings, molecular graphs) with rich contextual descriptions (e.g., physicochemical properties). However, MoLMs can encode and propagate inaccuracies due to outdated web-mined training corpora or malicious manipulation, jeopardizing downstream discovery pipelines. While knowledge editing has been explored for general-domain AI, its application to MoLMs remains uncharted, presenting unique challenges due to the multifaceted and interdependent nature of molecular knowledge. In this paper, we take the first step toward MoLM editing for two critical tasks: molecule-to-caption generation and caption-to-molecule generation. To address molecule-specific challenges, we propose MolEdit, a powerful framework that enables targeted modifications while preserving unrelated molecular knowledge. MolEdit combines a Multi-Expert Knowledge Adapter that routes edits to specialized experts for different molecular facets with an Expertise-Aware Editing Switcher that activates the adapters only when input closely matches the stored edits across all expertise, minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. To systematically evaluate editing performance, we introduce MEBench, a comprehensive benchmark assessing multiple dimensions, including Reliability (accuracy of the editing), Locality (preservation of irrelevant knowledge), and Generality (robustness to reformed queries). Across extensive experiments on two popular MoLM backbones, MolEdit delivers up to 18.8% higher Reliability and 12.0% better Locality than baselines while maintaining efficiency.

As AD is irreversible, early prediction is critical for timely intervention and management. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively normal (CN) aging and AD, plays a significant role in early AD diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. To incorporate temporal progression, we further employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process features extracted from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with some other non-image biomarkers, predicting each subject's cognitive status at month 48. Our multimodal model achieved an average progression prediction accuracy of 95.05\% between sMCI and pMCI, outperforming existing studies in AD prediction. This work demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction and highlights the effectiveness of combining spatial and temporal modeling for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.</p></details> |  |

We present HumaniBench, a unified evaluation framework designed to characterize HC alignment across realistic, socially grounded visual contexts. HumaniBench contains 32,000 expert-verified image question pairs derived from real world news imagery and spanning seven evaluation tasks: scene understanding, instance identity, multiple-choice visual question answering (VQA), multilinguality, visual grounding, empathetic captioning, and image resilience testing. Each task is mapped to one or more HC principles through a principled operationalization of metrics covering accuracy, harmful content detection, hallucination and faithfulness, coherence, cross lingual quality, empathy, and robustness.We evaluate 15 state-of-the-art LMMs under this framework and observe consistent cross model trade offs: proprietary systems achieve the strongest performance on ethics, reasoning, and empathy, while open-source models exhibit superior visual grounding and resilience. All models, however, show persistent gaps in fairness and multilingual inclusivity. We further analyze the effect of inference-time techniques, finding that chain of thought prompting and test-time scaling yield 8 to 12 % improvements on several HC dimensions. HumaniBench provides a reproducible, extensible foundation for systematic HC evaluation of LMMs and enables fine-grained analysis of alignment trade-offs that are not captured by conventional multimodal benchmarks. https://vectorinstitute.github.io/humanibench/</p></details> |  |
| **[Architecture Decoupling Is Not All You Need For Unified Multimodal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22663v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding represent a significant step toward AGI and have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zhengdian1.github.io/AIA-project/ Code: https://github.com/zhengdian1/AIA</p></details> |

Despite the notable success of recent vision-language models (VLMs) on specialized tasks like chart-to-code generation, their reliance on single-task training regimens fosters a narrow paradigm that hinders the development of generalized \textbf{VI}sio\textbf{N} \textbf{C}ode \textbf{I}ntelligence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{VinciCoder}, a unified multimodal code generation model that addresses this limitation via a two-stage training framework. We begin by constructing a large-scale Supervised Finetuning (SFT) corpus comprising 1.6M image-code pairs for tasks involving direct code generation and visual-based code refinement. Subsequently, we introduce a Visual Reinforcement Learning (ViRL) strategy, which employs a coarse-to-fine reward mechanism to improve visual fidelity by calculating visual similarity across local and global image patches. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal code generation benchmarks demonstrate that VinciCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent open-source models. The ablation study further validates the effectiveness of our proposed coarse-to-fine ViRL strategy. The data, code and model is available at https://github.com/DocTron-hub/VinciCoder.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

While existing methods commonly utilize techniques such as contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms to align cross-modal emotional semantics, they typically overlook modality-specific emotional nuances like micro-expressions, tone variations, and sarcastic language. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orthogonal Disentanglement with Projected Feature Alignment (OD-PFA), a novel framework designed explicitly to capture both shared semantics and modality-specific emotional cues. Our approach first decouples unimodal features into shared and modality-specific components. An orthogonal disentanglement strategy (OD) enforces effective separation between these components, aided by a reconstruction loss to maintain critical emotional information from each modality. Additionally, a projected feature alignment strategy (PFA) maps shared features across modalities into a common latent space and applies a cross-modal consistency alignment loss to enhance semantic coherence. Extensive evaluations on widely-used benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed OD-PFA multimodal emotion recognition tasks, as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Angle-Optimized Partial Disentanglement for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22447v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) aims to enhance emotion understanding by integrating complementary cues from text, audio, and visual modalities. Existing MERC approaches predominantly focus on cross-modal shared features, often overlooking modality-specific features that capture subtle yet critical emotional cues such as micro-expressions, prosodic variations, and sarcasm. Although related work in multimodal emotion recognition (MER) has explored disentangling shared and modality-specific features, these methods typically employ rigid orthogonal constraints to achieve full disentanglement, which neglects the inherent complementarity between feature types and may limit recognition performance. To address these challenges, we propose Angle-Optimized Feature Learning (AO-FL), a framework tailored for MERC that achieves partial disentanglement of shared and specific features within each modality through adaptive angular optimization. Specifically, AO-FL aligns shared features across modalities to ensure semantic consistency, and within each modality it adaptively models the angular relationship between its shared and modality-specific features to preserve both distinctiveness and complementarity. An orthogonal projection refinement further removes redundancy in specific features and enriches shared features with contextual information, yielding more discriminative multimodal representations. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of AO-FL for MERC, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, AO-FL can be seamlessly integrated with various unimodal feature extractors and extended to other multimodal fusion tasks, such as MER, thereby highlighting its strong generalization beyond MERC.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Given an idiom, the system iteratively (i) generates detailed visual prompts, (ii) synthesizes an image, (iii) infers the idiom from the image, and (iv) refines the prompt until recognition succeeds or a step limit is reached. Using 1,000 idioms as inputs, we synthesize a corresponding dataset of visual pun images with paired prompts, enabling benchmarking of both generation and understanding. Experiments across 10 LLMs, 10 MLLMs, and one T2IM (Qwen-Image) show that MLLM choice is the primary performance driver: GPT achieves the highest accuracies, Gemini follows, and the best open-source MLLM (Gemma) is competitive with some closed models. On the LLM side, Claude attains the strongest average performance for prompt generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026 (under review)</p></details> |

However, the integration of multiple modalities introduces heterogeneity in both the model and training data, creating unique systems challenges. We propose DistTrain, a disaggregated training system for multimodal LLMs. DistTrain incorporates two novel disaggregation techniques to address model and data heterogeneity, respectively. The first is disaggregated model orchestration, which separates the training for modality encoder, LLM backbone, and modality generator. This allows the three components to adaptively and independently orchestrate their resources and parallelism configurations. The second is disaggregated data preprocessing, which decouples data preprocessing from training. This eliminates resource contention between preprocessing and training, and enables efficient data reordering to mitigate stragglers within and between microbatches caused by data heterogeneity. We evaluate DistTrain across different sizes of multimodal LLMs on a large-scale production cluster. The experimental results show that DistTrain achieves 54.7% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) when training a 72B multimodal LLM on 1172 GPUs and outperforms Megatron-LM by up to 2.2x on training throughput.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGCO...</summary><p>SIGCOMM 2025 (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3718958.3750472)</p></details> |

We demonstrate that models can exploit these shortcuts, achieving comparable results using visual cues alone. To address this, we introduce Relational Entity Text-Image kNowledge Augmented (RETINA) benchmark, automatically constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline, consisting of 120k training and 2k human-curated test set. RETINA contains queries referencing secondary subjects (i.e. related entities) and pairs them with images of these related entities, removing the visual shortcut. When evaluated on RETINA existing models show significantly degraded performance, confirming their reliance on the shortcut. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Image MultImodal Retriever (MIMIR), which enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities, effectively handling RETINA, unlike prior work that uses only a single image per document. Our experiments validate the limitations of existing benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of RETINA and MIMIR. Our project is available at: Project Page.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReGATE: Learning Faster and Better with Fewer Tokens in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21420v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grows rapidly with the number of processed tokens. Existing efficiency methods mainly target inference via token reduction or merging, offering limited benefits during training. We introduce ReGATE (Reference-Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework, in which a frozen teacher LLM provides per-token guidance losses that are fused with an exponential moving average of the student's difficulty estimates. This adaptive scoring mechanism dynamically selects informative tokens while skipping redundant ones in the forward pass, substantially reducing computation without altering the model architecture. Across three representative MLLMs, ReGATE matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 38% of the tokens. With extended training, it even surpasses the baseline across multiple multimodal benchmarks, cutting total token usage by over 41%. Code and models will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we extend the application of SAEs to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, and introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating monosemanticity at the neuron-level in visual representations. To ensure that our evaluation aligns with human perception, we propose a benchmark derived from a large-scale user study. Our experimental results reveal that SAEs trained on VLMs significantly enhance the monosemanticity of individual neurons, with sparsity and wide latents being the most influential factors. Further, we demonstrate that applying SAE interventions on CLIP's vision encoder directly steers multimodal LLM outputs (e.g., LLaVA), without any modifications to the underlying language model. These findings emphasize the practicality and efficacy of SAEs as an unsupervised tool for enhancing both interpretability and control of VLMs. Code and benchmark data are available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/sae-for-vlm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, most prior approaches update their world representation only at discrete update points such as navigation targets, waypoints, or the end of an action step, leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures: overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning. To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions. Evaluated in three real world environments with dynamic object placement, BINDER achieves substantially higher success and efficiency than SoTA baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for real world deployment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Yet, despite notable progress in deepfake detection, current forensic systems degrade sharply under real-world conditions such as severe downsampling, compression, and cross-domain distribution shifts. Moreover, most detectors operate as opaque classifiers, offering little insight into why an image is flagged as synthetic, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings. We introduce INSIGHT (Interpretable Neural Semantic and Image-based Generative-forensic Hallucination Tracing), a unified multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16 - 64x64). INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without inducing misleading artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions indicative of generative patterns, and CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors. A vision-language model is then prompted using a structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol to produce consistent, fine-grained explanations, verified through a dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to minimize hallucinations and ensure factuality. Across diverse domains, including animals, vehicles, and abstract synthetic scenes, INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establish INSIGHT as a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification.</p></details> | 36 pages, 17 figures |

To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence (SI). We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a growing collection of newly curated ones, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in SI, yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail the most advanced multimodal models. EASI is an ongoing community effort: we have open-sourced the EASI codebase that provides a one-stop and reproducible solution with standardized interfaces, integrated protocols and prompts that significantly reduce the friction of configuring and running multiple benchmarks; we have also launched an accompanying EASI leaderboard to provide a continually updated snapshot of model performance across the full SI spectrum, accelerating collective progress toward robust SI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codeb...</summary><p>Codebase: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/EASI/; Leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmms-lab-si/EASI-Leaderboard</p></details> |

While recent methods automate concept generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they still face three fundamental challenges: poor visual grounding, concept redundancy, and the absence of principled metrics to balance predictive accuracy and concept compactness. We introduce PS-CBM, a Partially Shared CBM framework that addresses these limitations through three core components: (1) a multimodal concept generator that integrates LLM-derived semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) a Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA), a post-hoc metric that jointly captures both predictive accuracy and concept compactness. Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show that PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts. These results underscore PS-CBM's effectiveness in achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables, Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Empirically, we find that MLLMs attend disproportionately to task-irrelevant background regions compared with text-only LLMs, implying spurious background-answer correlations. We claim and analyze that (i) outcome-based rewards can be an important factor leading to spurious correlations, and (ii) spurious correlations can be an important factor leading to hallucinations. Based on these results, we propose Causal-Oriented Policy Optimization (COPO) to mitigate these spurious correlations, thus addressing the issue of hallucinations. It imposes token-level sufficiency and necessity constraints to measure each inference token's causal contribution, thus ensuring correct and evidence-grounded output. Specifically, we first evaluate each token's causal contribution via a newly proposed causal completeness reward. This reward is then used to construct a causally informed advantage function within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on tokens that are causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of COPO.</p></details> |  |

However, current research focuses on simple video scenarios, failing to reflect the complex and diverse nature of real-world audio-visual events in videos. To bridge this gap, we firstly introduce R-AVST, a dataset for audio-visual reasoning featuring fine-grained spatio-temporal annotations. In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models. To the best of our knowledge, R-AVST is the first dataset designed for real-world audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, and AVST-Zero offers a novel perspective for tackling future challenges in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

It demands precise attention to subtle visual details to distinguish between visually similar subcategories--details that MLLMs may easily overlook without explicit guidance. To address this, we introduce AutoSEP, an iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework designed to enhance MLLM fine-grained classification capabilities in a fully unsupervised manner. Our core idea is to leverage unlabeled data to learn a description prompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within an image, and boosts classification accuracy. We developed an automatic self-enhancing prompt learning framework called AutoSEP to iteratively improve the description prompt using unlabeled data, based on instance-level classification scoring function. AutoSEP only requires black-box access to MLLMs, eliminating the need for any training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach on multiple fine-grained classification datasets. It consistently outperforms other unsupervised baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our self-supervised optimization framework. Notably, AutoSEP on average improves 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over the best-performing baselines.

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.</p></details> |  |

Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames.

Existing methods typically rely on extensive task-specific annotations and fine-tuning, limiting their ability to generalize effectively to novel or out-of-distribution scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce GroundingAgent, a novel agentic visual grounding framework that operates without any task-specific fine-tuning. GroundingAgent employs a structured, iterative reasoning mechanism that integrates pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and large language models (LLMs) to progressively refine candidate regions through joint semantic and spatial analyses. Remarkably, GroundingAgent achieves an average zero-shot grounding accuracy of 65.1 % on widely-used benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg), entirely without fine-tuning. Furthermore, by substituting MLLM-generated captions with the original query texts, the accuracy at the selection stage alone reaches approximately 90 %, closely matching supervised performance and underscoring the critical role of LLM reasoning capabilities. GroundingAgent also offers strong interpretability, transparently illustrating each reasoning step and providing clear insights into its decision-making process.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates. Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 26 baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust zero-shot generalization.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment. We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking. VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[OVOD-Agent: A Markov-Bandit Framework for Proactive Visual Reasoning and Self-Evolving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21064v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaptionQA: Is Your Caption as Useful as the Image Itself?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21025v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges such as factual inaccuracies, harmful content, biases, hallucinations, and privacy risks compromise their reliability. This study introduces Trust-videoLLMs, a first comprehensive benchmark evaluating 23 state-of-the-art videoLLMs (5 commercial, 18 open-source) across five critical dimensions: truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy. Comprising 30 tasks with adapted, synthetic, and annotated videos, the framework assesses spatiotemporal risks, temporal consistency and cross-modal impact. Results reveal significant limitations in dynamic scene comprehension, cross-modal perturbation resilience and real-world risk mitigation. While open-source models occasionally outperform, proprietary models generally exhibit superior credibility, though scaling does not consistently improve performance. These findings underscore the need for enhanced training datat diversity and robust multimodal alignment. Trust-videoLLMs provides a publicly available, extensible toolkit for standardized trustworthiness assessments, addressing the critical gap between accuracy-focused benchmarks and demands for robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy.</p></details> |  |

A Survey of Advancements in Multimodal Reasoning (v1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03151v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is central to human intelligence, enabling structured problem-solving across diverse tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their reasoning abilities in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic domains. However, effectively extending these capabilities into multimodal contexts-where models must integrate both visual and textual inputs-continues to be a significant challenge. Multimodal reasoning introduces complexities, such as handling conflicting information across modalities, which require models to adopt advanced interpretative strategies. Addressing these challenges involves not only sophisticated algorithms but also robust methodologies for evaluating reasoning accuracy and coherence. This paper offers a concise yet insightful overview of reasoning techniques in both textual and multimodal LLMs. Through a thorough and up-to-date comparison, we clearly formulate core reasoning challenges and opportunities, highlighting practical methods for post-training optimization and test-time inference. Our work provides valuable insights and guidance, bridging theoretical frameworks and practical implementations, and sets clear directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has been conducted on integrating external knowledge for reasoning in large language models (LLMs), such efforts remain underexplored in VLMs, where the challenge is compounded by the need to bridge multiple modalities seamlessly. This work introduces a framework for knowledge-guided reasoning in VLMs, leveraging structured knowledge graphs for multi-hop verification using image-captioning task to illustrate our framework. Our approach enables systematic reasoning across multiple steps, including visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement. We evaluate the framework using hierarchical, triple-based and bullet-point based knowledge representations, analyzing their effectiveness in factual accuracy and logical inference. Empirical results show that our approach improves factual accuracy by approximately 31% on preliminary experiments on a curated dataset of mixtures from Google Landmarks v2, Conceptual captions and Coco captions revealing key insights into reasoning patterns and failure modes. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating external knowledge for advancing reasoning in VLMs, paving the way for more reliable and knowledgable multimodal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as poster at NewInML Workshop ICML, 2025</p></details> |

As such, in this work, we propose a novel benchmarking approach: in particular, we aim at building a curated dataset reflecting real world physical temporal dynamics, extracting temporal signals from real-world videos using optical flow. As such, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on state-of-the-art TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting show that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, suggesting limited generalizability to novel datasets. These findings underscore the need for novel approaches to acquiring time series data and highlight the lack of universality in recent TSFMs, while further validating the effectiveness of our video-based time series data extraction pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS) Workshop @ AAAI 2026: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications</p></details> |

However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Project page:https://hunyuan-gamecraft-2.github.io/</p></details> |

The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/showlab/RobotSeg</p></details> |
| **[Qwen3-VL Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21631v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.</p></details> | 42 pages |
| **[Watch and Learn: Learning to Use Computers from Online Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04673v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-using agents (CUAs) must plan task workflows across diverse and evolving applications, yet progress is limited by the lack of large-scale, high-quality training data. Existing datasets are narrow, static, and costly to annotate, while synthetic data often yields oversimplified or misaligned behaviors. We present Watch & Learn (W&L), a framework that converts readily available Internet videos of human computer use into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly generating actions or relying on handcrafted heuristics, we cast trajectory annotation as an inverse dynamics problem that predicts user actions from consecutive screen states, which simplifies learning and generalizes across domains. Through a task-aware retrieval and labeling pipeline, W&L yields over 53K high-quality trajectories that enhance CUAs both as in-context exemplars and as supervised training data. On OSWorld, it consistently improves general-purpose and specialized CUAs, while on WindowsAgentArena it achieves state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale models under the 15-step limit. These results show that web-scale human demonstration videos can serve as a practical and scalable foundation for advancing real-world CUAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing SAM 2 and SAM 3 for Zero-Shot Segmentation of 3D Medical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21926v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for promptable segmentation, including SAM, SAM 2, and the recently released SAM 3, have renewed interest in zero-shot segmentation of medical imaging. Although these models perform strongly on natural images, their behavior on medical data remains insufficiently characterized. While SAM 2 is widely used for annotation in 3D medical workflows, SAM 3 introduces a new perception backbone, detector-tracker pipeline, and concept-level prompting that may alter its behavior under spatial prompts. We present the first controlled comparison of SAM 2 and SAM 3 for zero-shot segmentation of 3D medical volumes and videos under purely visual prompting, with concept mechanisms disabled. We assess whether SAM 3 can serve as an out-of-the-box replacement for SAM 2 without customization. We benchmark both models on 16 public datasets (CT, MRI, 3D and cine ultrasound, endoscopy) covering 54 anatomical structures, pathologies, and surgical instruments. Prompts are restricted to the first frame and use four modes: single-click, multi-click, bounding box, and dense mask. This design standardizes preprocessing, prompt placement, propagation rules, and metric computation to disentangle prompt interpretation from propagation. Prompt-frame analysis shows that SAM 3 provides substantially stronger initialization than SAM 2 for click prompting across most structures. In full-volume analysis, SAM 3 retains this advantage for complex, vascular, and soft-tissue anatomies, emerging as the more versatile general-purpose segmenter. While SAM 2 remains competitive for compact, rigid organs under strong spatial guidance, it frequently fails on challenging targets where SAM 3 succeeds. Overall, our results suggest that SAM 3 is the superior default choice for most medical segmentation tasks, particularly those involving sparse user interaction or complex anatomical topology.</p></details> |  |

Our \textbf{SocialNav} is a foundational model for socially-aware navigation with a hierarchical "brain-action" architecture, capable of understanding high-level social norms and generating low-level, socially compliant trajectories. To enable such dual capabilities, we construct the SocNav Dataset, a large-scale collection of 7 million samples, comprising (1) a Cognitive Activation Dataset providing social reasoning signals such as chain-of-thought explanations and social traversability prediction, and (2) an Expert Trajectories Pyramid aggregating diverse navigation demonstrations from internet videos, simulated environments, and real-world robots. A multi-stage training pipeline is proposed to gradually inject and refine navigation intelligence: we first inject general navigation skills and social norms understanding into the model via imitation learning, and then refine such skills through a deliberately designed Socially-Aware Flow Exploration GRPO (SAFE-GRPO), the first flow-based reinforcement learning framework for embodied navigation that explicitly rewards socially compliant behaviors. SocialNav achieves +38% success rate and +46% social compliance rate compared to the state-of-the-art method, demonstrating strong gains in both navigation performance and social compliance.

We introduce ReasonAct, a method that enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%, 94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9, 15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our progressive training enables smaller models to achieve competitive video reasoning performance while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinity-RoPE: Action-Controllable Infinite Video Generation Emerges From Autoregressive Self-Rollout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20649v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autoregressive video diffusion models are constrained by three core bottlenecks: (i) the finite temporal horizon imposed by the base model's 3D Rotary Positional Embedding (3D-RoPE), (ii) slow prompt responsiveness in maintaining fine-grained action control during long-form rollouts, and (iii) the inability to realize discontinuous cinematic transitions within a single generation stream. We introduce $\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://infinity-rope.github.io/</p></details> |

A promising path forward is high-fidelity simulation that combines photorealistic sensor rendering with geometrically grounded interaction in complex, open-world urban environments. Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability. Beyond serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation, Wanderland's rich raw sensor data further allows benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models. Our work establishes a new foundation for reproducible research in open-world embodied AI. Project website is at https://ai4ce.github.io/wanderland/.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Despite their impressive capabilities, the robustness of these models under adversarial perturbations remains underexplored, which is a critical concern for safety-sensitive applications. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of adversarial vulnerability in unified multi-modal encoders. We find that even mild adversarial perturbations lead to substantial performance drops across all modalities. Non-visual inputs, such as audio and point clouds, are especially fragile, while visual inputs like images and videos also degrade significantly. To address this, we propose an efficient adversarial calibration framework that improves robustness across modalities without modifying pretrained encoders or semantic centers, ensuring compatibility with existing foundation models. Our method introduces modality-specific projection heads trained solely on adversarial examples, while keeping the backbone and embeddings frozen. We explore three training objectives: fixed-center cross-entropy, clean-to-adversarial L2 alignment, and clean-adversarial InfoNCE, and we introduce a regularization strategy to ensure modality-consistent alignment under attack. Experiments on six modalities and three Bind-style models show that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to 47.3 percent at epsilon = 4/255, while preserving or even improving clean zero-shot and retrieval performance with less than 1 percent trainable parameters.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing Video Reasoning LLMs suffer from perception shortcuts, relying on a flawed single-step perception paradigm. This paradigm describes the video and then conducts reasoning, which runs the risk of insufficient evidence and emergent hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce a new framework that integrates a loop-based paradigm with an anti-hallucination reward. First, to address the insufficient evidence, we introduce the Perception Loop Reasoning (PLR) paradigm. Instead of describing the video at once, each loop requires the model to describe a video segment with precise timestamps, analyze this segment, and decide the next action. Second, for the risk of hallucinations, the Factual-Aware Evaluator (FAE) evaluates each perception result as a reliable anti-hallucination reward. This reward encourages the model to provide sufficient and precise video evidence. Our FAE, which performs comparably to GPT-4o, is tuned on our AnetHallu-117K, a large-scale hallucination judgment preference dataset. Extensive experiments show that our Video-PLR achieves the state-of-the-art in both 3B and 7B parameter scales and has the best data efficiency. Our code, models, and datasets are released on: https://github.com/BoweiPu/VideoPLR.</p></details> | 32 pages, 36 figures |

However, it faces significant challenges in maintaining fidelity and temporal consistency. Existing methods, often designed for U-Net architectures, suffer from two primary limitations: inaccurate inversion due to first-order solvers, and contextual conflicts caused by crude "hard" feature replacement. These issues are more challenging in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), where the unsuitability of prior layer-selection heuristics makes effective guidance challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce ContextFlow, a novel training-free framework for DiT-based video object editing. In detail, we first employ a high-order Rectified Flow solver to establish a robust editing foundation. The core of our framework is Adaptive Context Enrichment (for specifying what to edit), a mechanism that addresses contextual conflicts. Instead of replacing features, it enriches the self-attention context by concatenating Key-Value pairs from parallel reconstruction and editing paths, empowering the model to dynamically fuse information. Additionally, to determine where to apply this enrichment (for specifying where to edit), we propose a systematic, data-driven analysis to identify task-specific vital layers.

| **[Exo2EgoSyn: Unlocking Foundation Video Generation Models for Exocentric-to-Egocentric Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20186v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation video generation models such as WAN 2.2 exhibit strong text- and image-conditioned synthesis abilities but remain constrained to the same-view generation setting. In this work, we introduce Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 that unlocks Exocentric-to-Egocentric(Exo2Ego) cross-view video synthesis. Our framework consists of three key modules. Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints. Together, these modules enable high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without retraining from scratch. Experiments on ExoEgo4D validate that Exo2EgoSyn significantly improves Ego2Exo synthesis, paving the way for scalable cross-view video generation with foundation models. Source code and models will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Text-Image-to-Video Generation: A Training-Free Approach to Flexible Visual Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20629v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-image-to-video (TI2V) generation is a critical problem for controllable video generation using both semantic and visual conditions. Most existing methods typically add visual conditions to text-to-video (T2V) foundation models by finetuning, which is costly in resources and only limited to a few pre-defined conditioning settings. To tackle these constraints, we introduce a unified formulation for TI2V generation with flexible visual conditioning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative training-free approach, dubbed FlexTI2V, that can condition T2V foundation models on an arbitrary amount of images at arbitrary positions. Specifically, we firstly invert the condition images to noisy representation in a latent space. Then, in the denoising process of T2V models, our method uses a novel random patch swapping strategy to incorporate visual features into video representations through local image patches. To balance creativity and fidelity, we use a dynamic control mechanism to adjust the strength of visual conditioning to each video frame. Extensive experiments validate that our method surpasses previous training-free image conditioning methods by a notable margin. Our method can also generalize to both UNet-based and transformer-based architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Click2Graph: Interactive Panoptic Video Scene Graphs from a Single Click](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15948v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[GigaBrain-0: A World Model-Powered Vision-Language-Action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19430v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale, GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures, colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain0.github.io/</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose SatSAM2, a zero-shot satellite video tracker built on SAM2, designed to adapt foundation models to the remote sensing domain. SatSAM2 introduces two core modules: a Kalman Filter-based Constrained Motion Module (KFCMM) to exploit temporal motion cues and suppress drift, and a Motion-Constrained State Machine (MCSM) to regulate tracking states based on motion dynamics and reliability. To support large-scale evaluation, we propose MatrixCity Video Object Tracking (MVOT), a synthetic benchmark containing 1,500+ sequences and 157K annotated frames with diverse viewpoints, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Extensive experiments on two satellite tracking benchmarks and MVOT show that SatSAM2 outperforms both traditional and foundation model-based trackers, including SAM2 and its variants. Notably, on the OOTB dataset, SatSAM2 achieves a 5.84% AUC improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset will be publicly released to encourage further research.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://gigaworld0.github.io/</p></details> |

This achievement is built upon several key components, including meticulous data curation, an advanced DiT architecture featuring selective and sliding tile attention (SSTA), enhanced bilingual understanding through glyph-aware text encoding, progressive pre-training and post-training, and an efficient video super-resolution network. Leveraging these designs, we developed a unified framework capable of high-quality text-to-video and image-to-video generation across multiple durations and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this compact and proficient model establishes a new state-of-the-art among open-source video generation models. By releasing the code and model weights, we provide the community with a high-performance foundation that lowers the barrier to video creation and research, making advanced video generation accessible to a broader audience.

| **[4DWorldBench: A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for 3D/4D World Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19836v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World Generation Models are emerging as a cornerstone of next-generation multimodal intelligence systems. Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text. These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation. However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability. To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms. To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods. This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence. Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments. We hope this benchmark will serve as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from "visual generation" to "world generation."

| **[Inferix: A Block-Diffusion based Next-Generation Inference Engine for World Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20714v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation. Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[fMRI-LM: Towards a Universal Foundation Model for Language-Aligned fMRI Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21760v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have enabled unified reasoning across images, audio, and video, but extending such capability to brain imaging remains largely unexplored. Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI.</p></details> |  |
