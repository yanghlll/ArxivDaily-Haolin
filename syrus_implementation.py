First, the language needs to be tightened so it reads as a concise technical pain point rather than a narrative. The mention of specific papers is interesting, but without context they can feel like unexplained name-drops, so they should either be framed more clearly or removed. The focus should be on the problem: too many submissions, hard to spot the truly relevant ones, and that blocking production adoption of cutting-edge models. That can be said more directly.

A cleaner version could be:

> The high volume of daily ArXiv submissions makes it impractical for developers to manually identify high-impact breakthroughs—such as large-scale works on World Models or Video Foundation Models—creating a bottleneck for integrating the latest research into production systems.

This keeps the urgency, names the problem, and stays GitHub-friendly without unnecessary detail.
